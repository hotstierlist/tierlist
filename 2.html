<p><b>Welcome to this purely subjective list, based on my personal experiences with the included players. If someone you expect to see isn't here, it likely means I haven't played with them enough or don't know them well enough to make an informed entry. First impressions can be misleading, as evidenced by some examples on this list. Naturally, the list will become more accurate as I gain more experience with players both in and outside the game.
</p>
<p>I have a strong background in competitive gaming (primarily Dota2 & Overwatch). HotS, even with its many flaws satisfies my "competitive MOBA" needs. The teamfighting aspect for me is the greatest part, as that's always the part I enjoyed the most in team games. Not soaking or farming or jungling for half an hour, but actually setting up and executing a teamfight and see who the better team is, pure skill, nothing else. There is winning and there's learning, and I have no trouble losing, unless it was caused by someone who intentionally griefed/sabotaged the game. As a result, I absolutely detest and abhor game ruiners, griefers, afkers, leavers and anyone that might disrupt the intergrity of a pure, balanced 5v5 game, compromising sportsmanship. If that makes me a "Tryhard" then so be it, but I strongly stand that in team-oriented games, things like integrity, loyalty, and sportsmanship should reign supreme. Prioritizing these values is crucial, otherwise what's the point?<br>
Often I hear "just play for fun". Well who says I don't? I absolutely have fun by giving it my best. I absolutely have fun by being a reliable, dependable teammate. I have fun by seeing others have fun playing with me and making good memories (and epic gamer moments) together. Showing loyalty and receiving loyalty back. Seeing other people invite you the next day, the next week, the next month after you've played together as that shows that they enjoyed their time with you, that is the biggest compliment you can receive. I pride myself on being one of the most reliable teammates you’ll ever encounter, and I welcome anyone to challenge that assertion. That does not mean I do not know how to have fun. I do troll and joke around, but not at the expense of my teammates, not at the expense of the game quality, not at the expense of screwing over a draft. I will never have fun at the expense of others, that would make me feel very uncomfortable. I'm a quality over quantity kind of person.<br>
I detest trolls, griefers and any form of game sabotaging. You will never see me bstep, throw, taunt, dance on the enemies <i>(If you do that, you are cringe)</i> unless an enemy did it first and I was just serving them some karma. What comes around goes around.</p>
<p>If you have heard good things about me, dismiss them. If you have heard bad things about me, dismiss them. Do your own research and digging, make up your own mind. I'm very sociable and easy to reach (discord 0cage). Don't get your answers handed for you, without even looking up yourself. "Some people dislike me without ever speaking to me—usually because they took someone else’s word for it. Often, it’s from players I refused to team with due to their toxic, manipulative, or griefing behavior. A lot of the rumors about me are exaggerated or false. The only true part is that I’ve called out game ruiners in frustration—like someone AFKing or intentionally feeding early. I usually ignore it, but sometimes it spills over when a win is within reach and someone throws it. I never start toxicity—I only ever respond to it. (Look quote at the bottom). Game sabotaging is bannable in most other multiplayer games, but for some reason in HotS its all fine. As always, great work from the folks at Blizzard! /s</p>
<p>Anyway, let's get down to the List of people I most enjoy playing with and Hover over a Player name to see more information.

<small>I met <font color="#827ee9">athleticBird</font> right at the time, when I was severely downsizing my friendlist, because people were dishonest and hypocritical, nobody was loyal, people were just using you for winrate, while badmouthing you behind your back and I was trying to increase the quality of my friends at the expense of their quantity. Initially I had normal, good impressions playing with him, nothing extraordinary - but the more we played, the more it got me excited to return the next day and play more. I would totally sync up to his time schedule the fun and quality of games we had increased exponentially as we got to know each other better. Today, I can say from the bottom of my heart that this is the nicest, chillest, calmest, most understanding dude I’ve met online and words cannot express how much I value him as a friend and as a human being in general. He is never toxic, he is very understanding and empathetic, of course there is always lively banter and is truly the hero we need, but do not deserve in this community. For me, he is irreplaceable. For the first time in my life, I’m being selfish because I want to enjoy all the fun and banter together, without risking missing out on good times. I know I don’t deserve such an amazing friend. If it weren’t for him, I would have uninstalled the game long ago. So you can kinda blame the Bird for this tierlist, because if it wasn’t for him, this tierlist would not exist <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/mrGKZf2d/jonahlaugh.png"></small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"An exceptional player, but more importantly, an even more remarkable individual. Friendly, non-judgmental, and overflowing with positivity, athleticBird embodies good vibes and camaraderie without any ego. He consistently helps create incredible moments while gaming, leading to lasting, cherished memories. Engaging with "The Bird" isn’t just about gaming; it’s a delightful experience filled with socializing and lively banter. Truly, the hero the HotS community needs—but does not deserve, not by a long shot."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Blodcool</font> is one of the most relaxed and down-to-earth players I’ve ever met in Heroes of the Storm. He’s incredibly friendly and open-minded, with zero trace of arrogance or ego. Instead, he brings a calm, welcoming presence and is always happy to engage with anyone who treats others with respect and kindness. Forgiving and empathetic, he sets a great example of what good sportsmanship looks like.

When it comes to gameplay, Blodcool is a formidable force in the ranged assassin role. Playing alongside him isn’t just fun—it’s genuinely rewarding. His combination of laid-back attitude and sharp skill makes him an absolute pleasure to have on your team.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Blodcool is a highly skilled player in Heroes of the Storm, particularly known for his expertise in the ranged assassin role.

Playing alongside Blodcool offers a chance to learn and grow, as his high-level gameplay sets a standard for excellence in the game.

<small>I absolutely love not only playing, but simply socializing with <font color="#827ee9">Predton</font>. The man is so pure, so chill, so wholesome - it is always lots of fun playing with him and he is always so outgoing and positive, while being a standout player. I was blessed to randomly meet him in a solo quickmatch game, where he was duoing with one of his friends and we added each other. His Auriel was and still is GODLIKE. That is the beauty of online games, making such lasting, quality friendships out of nowhere, I wish it happened more frequently, unfortunately it is extremely rare that this happens in Heroes of the Storm. I wonder why ;)<br>Predton is exceptional, and even though his appearances are rare, I’ve always admired him as a shining example to everyone. If every online gamer were like him, we would have peace in this world.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Among the standout players you could ever encounter in solo queue, meeting and playing with such a person is a truly wonderful and delightful experience. Their presence adds an element of fun and joy to the game that is unmatched. Regrettably, even though his appearances have been rare, his kindness and positive influence will resonate long after the game ends. His friendly, supportive nature, and good understanding of the game, plus his impressive adaptability leave a lasting positive impression, making every interaction memorable. His rare appearances only make those moments more treasured, as his impact and kindness echo forever in the hearts of those who have had the pleasure of playing with him."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">NightNight</font> is such an amazing guy that you would just love to play with. Welcoming any challenge, he is as skilled as they come and I’ve never had a game with him that I did not enjoy or that I wish I wasn’t there. Even if it was some unenjoyable game, due to whatever reasons, I was just happy that I got his back and I know he had mine, we know we can rely on each other. Amazing player and more importantly - a chill, laidback, awesome type of human being. Sometimes he would get hate whispers after a 2v5 game we’ve had, accusing him of cheating/hacking <i>(Daaamn, are we that good?)</i> and I chuckle at those. NightNight is responsible (in part) for one of my best gaming memories of my life, a night when he, Tapajoey, and I had an awesome gaming session together while they were both drunk. It was amazing. One of the many reasons I love playing with him is because it challenges me and pushes me to my limits in keeping him alive and/or supporting him. His playstyle is very aggressive, almost too aggressive, which makes every game thrilling. He is the first player from HotS with whom I’ve stayed in contact, and I’ll gladly continue to do so even after our HotS days are over. I’m happy to call him a lifelong friend.</small></p><br>

<small><font color="#827ee9">QopenHagen</font> is the oldest friend I have in HotS that is still actively playing. When I was checking the stats of my first-ever HotS account, I was very surprised to find out that I practically learned to play Abathur while in party with him, mostly on his Samuro (while having little recollection of those events), back in 2016, and that in my years of absence from HotS he had become what many consider to be the best offlaner in the game. I am sure that he has helped countless players improve at the game (I know he helped me a lot) and I particularly find his stream not only entertaining, but also helpful. It is "comforting" to know that there are terrible, toxic griefers not only in the casual modes, but in Ranked only and for some reason Qopen is a magnet to these folks. He needs to reduce his focus on the trolls, who are trying to provoke him as he becomes easily frustrated with lackluster teammates or unfortunate game situations, tilting his focus away from being at his absolute best. And when he is at his absolute best - good luck stopping him. We rarely play together anymore, just like most Ranked players, the only time they need you is to clear their leaver games in ARAMS (LOL). Nonetheless, he is a tremendous player, and I wish him all the very best. Plus I love people with whom I have shared Dota2 experience, so we can basically relate to each other even outside of HotS. My advice to anyone ending up on Qopen’s team is - just do your best, try to support him and play around him, wait for his rotation, let him lead, he knows what he is doing.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Perhaps the best offlaner in the game. His talents are undeniable, he’s helped countless people improve at their game, but it’s perplexing to see him feeding the online trolls and give in to their provocations. And even though you cannot blame him, as there are plenty of insufferable trolls ruining games daily, it still might be more beneficial for him to dial it back and find more positive pursuits, recognizing he is at a skill level way above most of his teammates and they do not see the bigger picture as he does, so he either needs to elaborate to them (if they are willing to listen) or just ignore them altogether."</small></p>

<small>I am constantly mesmerized by <font color="#827ee9">Gaflo</font>’s ability to dictate the flow of the game and seamlessly narrate every moment from start to finish, making it look effortless. His presence not only makes the game smoother for his teammates but also elevates their play, creating a more structured and efficient experience. He’s the kind of player you can always learn from and grow with, fostering mutual improvement in a way that feels both natural and rewarding. His laid-back nature is commendable, while being very mature and intelligent, and even when at a disadvantage, he remains calm and analytical, breaking down the necessary steps to turn the game around with remarkable clarity. One memorable example was when he spent nearly three hours on stream debating an incredibly delusional Bronze player. Not once did he raise his voice or resort to rudeness. He calmly and patiently tried to make his point in the most respectful way possible. Sure, it was ultimately a lost cause—the other guy wasn’t grounded in reality—but the level of professionalism and restraint he showed throughout was remarkable. Personally, I would’ve thrown in the towel an hour earlier with a “you’re entitled to your wrong opinion” and moved on. It’s genuinely fascinating to observe how he thinks — a rare and exceptional individual, both personally and as a teammate. If you value absolute efficiency, objective focus and just the right touch of playful trolling, Gaflo is exactly who you want by your side.</small></p><br>

His ability to decipher, break down and "narrate" the game progress is pure ASMR to any ears. A rare, gifted individual with whom anyone would be lucky to play with."</small></p>

<small>Since the very beginning, I have always loved playing with <font color="#827ee9">Tapajoey</font>. He is typically very quiet, he doesn’t communicate a lot. But he is very reliable on his own and does not need to be supported by others. I’ve never seen him blame, rage or even ask for extra help, heals, support, whatever - he just tries to find opportunities on his own. Normally these are the traits of a 1v9 player, but not Tapajoey - he sometimes makes it work, while being wholesome and friendly himself. If I have a chance to include him in our group, I will always take it. Together with NightNight they are very close and when the three of us play together it is always a fun, pleasant experience that I will cherish for the rest of my days. Only the most blessed ones of us have seen his ultimate form - Drunk Joey. When he told me he is drunk, I expected complete clownfiesta and pepega gamestyle, but the man actually achieved his ultimate form and played better than ever LOL!</small></p><br>

I’m well aware that there are tons of negative rumors about him scripting, abusing, boosting, smurfing, whatever, but when I play with I see none of that - I see him for the extremely high skill he brings to the table and is really a pleasure to play alongside him, even if its just ARAMs to clear his leaver games. He is perhaps the best Hanzo in the game. Probably the worst kept secret in HotS, he is one of the many boosters behind BPRaiku, and I don’t know why he does it, it’s not nice, I wish he didn’t do it, it’s not like he needs to do it, but even with this downside, I cannot deny the raw mechanical skill he’s got. He’s a phenomenal player and he’s a force to be reckoned with ingame and personally I feel extremely confident having him on my team, because he maximizes opportunities and consistently delivers results. From my experience, he is also sociable and friendly and has never turned down a conversation. He is a very talented gamer outside of HotS as well.</small></p><br>

His dedication—to both the game and its community—is unmatched. In many ways, he’s as responsible for its continued relevance as anyone else in the scene.
What sets Hasu apart is his openness and generosity. He’s always willing to offer advice, break down strategies, and provide constructive feedback. Whether you’re a veteran or a newcomer, learning from him is consistently a rewarding experience. He makes you feel welcome, encourages discussion, and fosters a spirit of collaboration and improvement.
His streams are not only informative, but genuinely entertaining. And if, by some chance, you’ve been living under a rock—his legendary “Hasu lobbies” are among the best games you’ll find in Heroes of the Storm. Everyone wants in.
If you walk away from playing with or watching Hasu and haven’t learned something, the issue probably isn’t with him.

However, I’ve never had a personal issue with him and my first game with him (that I know of) dates back to 2019. I have very fond memories of us just duoing together in ARAM, those were always chill and fun. Despite him being surrounded by people who would lose a limb to see me suffer, he remains unaffected by their animosity towards me. I have always thoroughly enjoyed playing with him and have a lot of respect for how laid-back he is—almost too laid-back. My best guess is that he just doesn’t give a damn.

Whether on Twitch, in Storm League, or in ARAMs, he’s always a joy to be around. Most Storm League players dismiss ARAM as a trivial mode, often trolling or going AFK, but Kure approaches it differently. He commentates on the game, breaking everything down, analyzing it strategically, and offering friendly advice. I really appreciate this approach, as there’s never a bad time to learn, improve, and test the limits—whether it’s your own skills or the hero’s potential. Kure also deserves praise for playing on EU servers despite the handicap of NA ping. Yet, he never complains, whines, or uses it as an excuse. He’s a calm, strategic, and intelligent player, making him a pleasure to listen to and learn from. He always takes the time to explain and answer any questions you might have. His guides have helped numerous people improve their game. Kure is a joy to be around, and I highly recommend giving him a follow on Twitch and YouTube!</small></p><br>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Tirigon</font> is an all-round great guy to be around. For me, he is the perfect marriage between being approachable, communicative, creating a welcoming atmosphere as well as being dependable and consistent in gameplay. I think we both enjoy the game itself thoroughly, but we both understand that the quality of games is atrocious due to awful trolls that you meet every other quickmatch/aram, and we often comiserate together on that. It’s not like we can do something about it, but it’s good to have someone who understands you and shares your pain. I have yet to meet anyone that does not enjoy playing with Tirigon. I tried hard to find something negative to say about him or even a pet peeve I would have with him - but I can’t. Too wholesome maybe?</small></p><br>

<small><font color="#827ee9">cilium</font> is one of the first generation of Heroes of the Storm players that played the game competitively for teams like Natus Vincere and I’m happy to call him a friend. While active, he was an inspiration to play with and learn from, when HotS was in its very early stages(2015-2016). He is the one that introduced me to the game, after I desperately needed a Dota2 alternative, that didn’t require so much time investment. I had the amazing advantage of learning HotS next to a pro-player and it was amazing watching him dissect and carry each game with or without my help. Soon after, games became quite boring because I would just be his pocket healer and if he never dies we just stomp through everything, so when I told him I needed a challenge, a hard hero to play, I asked him to give me the hardest hero to be effective and try and when he said Abathur I went "Challenge accepted!" mode. I gave it a try and I was immediately inlove. The hero we now know today was such a unique take on a moba hero, it was so different than anything out there and I was amused and impressed. I found it interesting and refreshing and I still consider him "my main" to this day. Thanks, cilium, it was fun while it lasted!</small></p><br>

<small>Back in the HGC days, <font color="#827ee9">Chelvin</font> was my favorite person to play HotS with. I don’t have the experience with him that many other people have, but then again I didn’t play Ranked with him, aside from a couple of Team League games. He was often muted or silenced due to getting triggered in-game, but I never saw that side of him. His raw, pure skill was rare back then and I didn’t mind a little mild toxic chat, it never bothered me. I’ve always considered toxicity something I can manage, because I have a mute text/pings button. However, I can’t do anything about griefers or intentional feeders. His Ranked adventures aside, when he played with me, he was always chill and fun. Though, he would quickly abandon me for Ranked once his mates came online. Despite this, I had some of my most dominant 2v5 games with him, where our teammates were so pepega, so ineffective that it was essentially just the two of us carrying the game. Since his HotS retirement, he’s moved on to competitive Pokemon Unite and I’m happy for him. I still keep in touch with him from time to time, he PROMISED that we’ll have one more HotS game together and I intend to make him power through it.</small></p><br>

<small>I’ve had my ups and downs playing with <font color="#827ee9">Disciple</font> and being on the receiving end of him blaming me for random, silly quickmatch stuff, deleting me from friends after what I thought were nice games, getting away for months and then randomly readding me when I least expect it. For the longest time I had no idea what to expect from him. There could be a hundred good things happening, right plays, right calls, but he would focus on the one that’s bad. But even after everything I can still honestly say I’ve always enjoyed playing with him. He gets it, he gets how to play the game and what is objectively needed in most scenarios. When he is at his absolute best, he can take on anyone. It saddens me to see him lose focus in a game by engaging with and flaming underperforming or unhelpful randoms, who wouldn’t change their behavior no matter how he approached it. He needs to recognize that not everyone is at his skill level—nowhere near it, in fact—and he shouldn’t expect them to understand him. Once he understands that he can only control his own actions and that randoms won’t listen, no matter how well-intentioned the feedback is, I’m willing to bet he would have a much happier outlook and better results. He has already been spending more time playing in custom lobbies, scrims, tournaments and I’m truly happy for him, because I think that is the environment he is better suited for and can thrive in. Overall very good player, but can welcome improvement in the social aspect.</small></p><br>

The unfortunate piece here is that he is extremely easy to tilt/get frustrated and has displayed toxicity, blaming and finger-pointing, even when there was nothing to blame and without showing any remorse for his words and actions. As a top percentile player, he needs to recognize that not everyone on his team (especially in QM/ARAM) will be close to his skill level or share his understanding of the game. Instead of bickering with teammates when they make mistakes, he would be much more effective if he offered constructive advice or simply chose to ignore their errors."</small></p>

<small>With <font color="#827ee9">Nano</font>, things have shifted over time. He used to be a balanced and thoughtful player—it used to feel like what comes around goes around—but lately, his perspective has become increasingly clouded and irrational. There’s a noticeable double standard in how he judges situations—quick to blame others are wintrading or throwing, while overlooking his own mistakes. He often overthinks, convinced that everyone is in on this conspiracy theory against him, to wintrade him, and gives up far too early, even when the game is still very much winnable. Instead of adjusting, he spirals into a negative direction—showing he is playing with lack of care, picking questionable heroes, and making the match harder than it needs to be. Storm League can be rough place, sure, but Nano tilts at the drop of a hat, which makes comebacks unlikely. It’s disappointing, especially when you know he’s capable of better.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Nano is a mechanically skilled player with a deep passion for the game. While he can still be friendly and open when in the right mindset, his overall demeanor has shifted in recent times. He now tends to overanalyze situations and is quick to assume malicious intent from others—often jumping to conclusions about teammates wintrading or conspiring against him. His judgment can feel inconsistent, and when things don’t go his way early on, he’s prone to disengaging mentally, picking recklessly, and giving up prematurely—even when the match is still winnable.
While his competitive drive remains strong, it’s often undercut by a tendency to spiral emotionally, making him vulnerable to provocation and frustration. With more focus on staying grounded and less on perceived slights or conspiracies, Nano could regain the clarity and leadership that once made him such a valuable teammate and enjoyable presence in-game."</small></p>

<small>I am grateful for meeting and knowing <font color="#827ee9">Twice</font>, as he is one of those people that, once you play with them, you instantly regret not meeting sooner. He’s got a strong game sense, sharp mechanics and I genuinely loved playing with him for all those reasons (and more).

What’s funny is, he’s always the first to tell others to ignore trolls and provocateurs, but he rarely follows his own advice. In Quickmatch especially, if the team is AFK, no one’s soaking, and camps are being ignored, he gets visibly agitated—and that’s usually when all hell breaks loose. B-stepping, taunting, maybe a little feeding—you know, the full chaotic Quickmatch package.

To be fair, in Storm League or any serious setting, he’s way more composed and focused. But in more casual matches, the tilt is real. He can also be a bit dismissive and even come off as rude sometimes, especially when things aren’t going his way. Still, flaws and all, I like having him on my team, even if I’m sure he doesn’t care if I’m on his.</small></p><br>

When that switch flips, things can spiral fast—BMing, feeding, taunting, and full-on chaos. He can also come off as dismissive and occasionally rude, snapping in the heat of the moment. A great player, but definitely one with a bad temper."</small></p>

While on a trip in Italy, we bonded over HotS together and I really liked how he was always staying concentrated and minimizing distractions during the game, giving it his all, while being very friendly and compassionate. He solely sponsored his own esports org Chilly Mountain, supporting the scene in ways most can only dream of.

<small>I love grouping up with <font color="#827ee9">LegendaryBBQ</font> and I can try hard, and I still wouldn’t find anything negative to say about him. He is always super fun to be around, his banter with Nitram (the two are inseperabale) is always funny and uplifting the mood of the group. My personal favorite is when they start spam-pinging each other And unlike his friends, I consider him the only one of his friends that is actually a team player and will put importance over what his team requires him, not just 1v9 or 1v5 every game like most of them. Being considerate is something I value greatly and I appreciate that he is, if not anything else, then at least trying to help his team, because most of his friends would selfishly put themselves first, and team - a distant second.</small></p><br>

I follow this approach myself and am often surprised when others perceive it as personal criticism and take offense. While I can’t say with absolute certainty, I believe Sven, as a veteran, is likely someone who values mutual respect and will treat you with respect if you show him the same. Knowing the HotS community (and what’s left of it) I’m sure he’s been through a lot of unpleasant experiences, so don’t blame him if he’s not overly optimistic, be respectful and try your best - I’m sure he will appreciate that and you will thus mutually increase the quality of life of the game(s) you share. <br>You might see him ARAMing when he has leaver games <img src="https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/381875/2" width="20"></small></p><br>

<small>Okay, please excuse the arrogance on my part, but I did not think I will see/meet a healer in my casual quickmatch game that will impress me, because it has been a good 2 years since last it happened (That was Predton). That was until I met <font color="#827ee9">Ruutek</font>, who I met via Twice, another Polish player. Ruutek is a very dedicated healer, he absolutely gets what he is there for and is very dedicated, has a very good understanding of how a proper Healer should be played in Heroes of the Storm. Truly remarkable, it allowed me to play so open and so free, without worrying that my Healer might be soft afk, tunnel-visioned or simply slow reflexes. He always knew exactly where to be and how to press. 90% of the Healer’s job is positioning and he nailed it. Outside the game, he was always very friendly and welcoming. Truly a remarkable and rare individual. Sadly, he does not play much anymore.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"A remarkable player who excels in the Healer role, Ruutek possesses exceptional positioning skills and a deep understanding of game and his primary role. His playstyle is characterized by a dependable and reliable approach, consistently providing excellent support to his team. His focused and dedicated nature ensures that his teammates receive their much needed heals timely and effectively, allowing them to perform at their best. Despite his prowess, it’s disheartening to note that his presence and activity within the game have dwindled in recent times."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">JANISSARY</font> is arguably the best Kerrigan, and I’ve always enjoyed my games with him, doing my best to support him in any way I can. In-game, there were no issues, but outside the game, his personality often reared its ugly head. He was quite hostile and selective towards newcomers, convinced that everyone was out to get him and steal or copy his playstyle. His stubbornness and selfishness often cast a shadow over what was almost always an enjoyable playtime. Fortunately, he ended his run on a good note and decided to leave the game, admitting that he felt bad for ruining the experience for so many innocent players while five-stacking himself. Apparently he had been whispered by one of their "victims" and after having a conversation with them, he was feeling pretty upset about ruining their fun. He hasn’t been seen in HotS since.</small></p><br>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Slick</font> approaches the game so differently from most people, he plays on his own terms, yet somehow makes it work. I’ve always enjoyed playing with him and I never felt we were in danger of losing if he was on one of his most played heroes, he just always delivered, even if the rest of the team were having rough times. This sense of leadership and taking things into his own hands, not being afraid of the enemy under any circumstance was always admirable. He is very chill, almost too chill, as sometimes if someone tries to disrupt the calmness within the game, he will snap and tell them to shush. Unfortunately, he is one of the rarest sights in HotS nowadays.</small></p><br>

It is sad that he only plays very sporadically nowadays."</small></p>

<small>The stories and good experiences I have with <font color="#827ee9">Chris</font> are so numerous and entertaining that we might need a tier list to do them justice. I’ve always enjoyed playing with him and have been his supporter and advocate since our very first game together. In the early days of knowing and playing with each other (2020-2021), I recall many ignorant and toxic players called him "Afk", useless and bad for focusing on objectives and soaking. When that happened, I wondered, "What is wrong with me? Do I not get it?" because I believed that soaking, doing objectives, and taking camps were crucial, and we needed at least one player handling those tasks. My strength had always been teamfighting, not macro play, so I was unsure of who was right and wrong. Yet, I still believed what he did was right—one person soaking while the rest of us looked for opportunities to force fights and take over the map. I’m glad I turned out to be correct. Nowadays, people greatly appreciate having someone who soaks and does the dirty work so the rest of the team can have fun. Chris was just ahead of his time with his approach. However, this makes him very dependent on his team; if they’re not having a good time, even if he’s doing his best offlaning, then he isn’t having a good time either. My one issue with him is that he is unwilling to speak up when unfair, unjust circumstances present themselves, just for the sake of being impartial. When facts speak, the gods remain silent. I solemnly believe that dismissively raising your hands in the face of deceit, lies and manipulation is part of the problem and that awful, downright toxic behavior should be challenged and risen up against. In many situations, choosing to remain impartial when you have an obligation to speak up and share the truth can be seen as a form of dishonesty or deception by omission. It’s important to consider the context and the impact of your silence on others. Sometimes speaking up is necessary to uphold honesty and integrity.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Empathetic, open-minded and non-judgmental, Chris embodies positivity in our community. He excels as both a dependable teammmate and even more, a fantastic friend. Gaming and chatting with him can take hours and you wouldn’t even notice how quick time passes. Nonetheless, his commitment to remaining impartial and neutral to avoid drama, especially in the presence of undeniable evidence, can sometimes lead to feelings of frustration."</small></p>

From my experience with him, having known him for a while now, he is an incredibly selfless, team-first teammate. Most people instantly (and often selfishly) lock the hero they want to play in QM/ARAM and I thought I was the only one, but Guillaume waits to pick last. He will almost always flex, he will always kindly ask you what you want to play and he will be very mindful and respectful of his team and team needs. Though versatile on any role, I particularly admire him as a Healer. His selfless nature ensures he prioritizes the team’s needs and maintains a keen awareness of his positioning. I know I’ve got good saves and cleanses, but his are nothing to ignore either. Unfortunately, he has recently been plagued by internet connectivity issues, leading to frequent in-game disconnections.

<small><font color="#827ee9">Sugårdaddy69</font> is a very kind and understanding individual, and I’ve had long and respectful conversations with him, so I know he is incredibly intelligent and wise. Outside of the game, he is one of my favorite people to converse with as we strive to elevate the experience for both of us. In-game, there are aspects of his playstyle that I admire and others that I strongly dislike. He is a wildcard and very unpredictable in-game. Some games he is a delight to be around to see him take the game in his hands and run with it. Others he would be extremely underwhelming, not really delivering anything of value to his team. An example - his was the worst Medivh I have ever seen in my life, completely oblivious to what’s happening in the game and where he needs to be. In his words, he should not tryhard and play his best while ARAMing and I completely agree, but when you see a teammate dying and you have at least 3 abilities active (not on cooldown) that can save them, I think you should press at least one, no matter how hard you are trolling or not taking it seriously. Overall I do like playing with him and I do cut him some slack, because I agree with his premise, but we both understand that our experience together could be greatly improved with some reciprocity.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Sugårdaddy69 (aka BOSSBANGER) is a very kind and understanding individual that doesn’t take many things seriously. He is a better player than he has chosen to portray himself to be, simply because he chooses to be goofing around and having fun. If you like to be kept at the edge of your seat, he is the best potential teammate candidate for you. Expect the unexpected while playing together - in some games he can be extremely good, while in others he can be very underwhelming. Like many, he seeks enjoyment and casual amusement from the game, yet sometimes trolling and griefing, thereby diminishing the overall quality of the experience. His "act first, ask questions later/balls deep" playing style, aptly reflected in his provocative moniker, leads to compromised KDA, perhaps because most ARAMs are easy even when you’re in a group."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">gomabad</font> is he most consistent Valeera player to date, probably the best one I know. The only one that comes close to mind is Nano, his Valeera is also extremely solid. Despite the hero being extremely inconsistent, vulnerable and hard to achieve succes on certain maps and certain matchups, gomabad somehow always made it work. Always. I never saw him struggle on Valeera and he always delivered results. Most other Valeeras need babysitting, need an abathur hat, a healer or tank on standby, but he never needed or required any of those and just looked for and created his own opportunities. When playing together, a major focus should be to enable him, support him well and watch him win the game for you and make it look easy. He is about the only good player ever introduced to me by Jared. Everyone else has been, excuse the expression, but pure poop. </small></p><br>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Deathknight</font> is the person with whom I’ve gone the longest without losing. We played 139 ARAMs together before experiencing our first loss, and only because the draft was so unfavorable. But whatever, I still think that’s quite impressive. DK just wants to game and I can appreciate that, that is why I like playing with him. I’ve also noticed that he dislikes bsteppers/taunters and he quickly removes them from the group if they do that, which I am strongly in favor of. However, even after all that time, he never warmed up to me. Some people take time to open up and get comfortable, but with him, it might take a year (or more) of playing together just to be added as a friend, and another year before he speaks to you. At that rate, you might become friends by the time Halley’s comet returns. All in all I do enjoy playing with him, but I’m not so sure he enjoys playing with me. He is selective AF. Brb learning German so he finally might open up.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Deathknight is a highly private and selective individual. He prefers to game exclusively with his close-knit group of friends and tends to avoid interactions outside that circle. While not unfriendly, he’s notably reserved and often uninterested in engaging with the broader community—so it’s unlikely you’ll find yourself on his team unless you’re part of his trusted crew."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Minimilk</font> is a lovable troll. I both love and abhor playing with him. On one hand, he is a skilled player who knows exactly what needs to be done and that is a privilege for any player, who wishes to support him. On the other hand, he prefers to troll, having fun at the expense of the backline—me, in this case. I could be getting dived by 3 tanks and bruisers, but he never returns to help the backline or support, instead opting to run it down and do his own thing. He’s probably killed more healers on his own team than on the enemy team. And yet, I kept trying. Playing with friends should involve some form of reciprocation and returning the favor. So, I’m still on the fence, but generally, I do enjoy playing with him. He’s more social than Hiraeth, although that doesn’t say much.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Minimilk undoubtedly showcases a remarkable skill set, but his gameplay is often characterized by a trolling approach.

<td class="tooltip" data-tippy-content='<h4 class="m-0 mb-1 text-center"><span class="fi fi-vn rounded-1"></span> Serdath <font color="#ffc85e"> <b>★</b></font></h4>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bJvYBJYK/zeratul.png" width="32"> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tT7yzM2b/ragnaros.png" width="32"> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7LPbFDxr/dehaka.png" width="32"><br>
<small>There’s no denying <font color="#827ee9">Serdath</font>’s growth—just a couple of years ago, he wouldn’t even be your pick for Quick Match teammate. Today, he’s climbed the ladder across multiple accounts, consistently hitting GM on 10+ smurfs. That alone is impressive and speaks to his persistence, understanding of the system. He found a way to win—even if it’s not always pretty. He burned many bridges along the way.

I genuinely enjoyed playing with him… most of the time. The issue is, small inconveniences (like intentionally feeding randoms) can easily tilt him. He then masks his frustration with vague, non-committal statements that are impossible to argue with or clarify, which only fuels confusion or passive-aggressive conflict. It’s frustrating because, in many cases, we’re dealing with the same problem he’s upset about. Yet, he lashes out or blames others and hides in his shell.

One of Serdath’s most consistent traits is contradiction: he gives good advice, but often fails to follow it himself. He’ll abruptly shut down conversations, avoid accountability or remove people from his friend list without notice—except, of course, for HasuObs, whom he seems to be unhealthily fixated on. His ongoing obsession with Hasu, sniping games and oversharing behavior ("Its my dream to be like Hasu" comments) makes it awkward. Still, that’s preferable to hearing him defend the likes of Tychessa—a known troll with one of the worst reputations in the game—as simply “misunderstood.”

Emotionally, Serdath is volatile. He often has strong outbursts, abruptly cuts off communication and can create tension in group settings. He’s not the easiest person to be around, and his antisocial behavior definitely leaves a mark - such as throwing fits right in the middle of a LIVE tournament. But that said, you can’t deny how far he’s come. Whether you like him or not, he’s a player who figured out how to succeed in a harsh, thankless environment—and that’s worth something.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Serdath brings solid gameplay knowledge and mechanical skill to the table. While he’s capable of high-level play, consistency can be a challenge—emotional swings and tilting tendencies frequently impact his in-game performance. He’s prone to visible frustration, which can create tension and disrupt team cohesion during matches.

Socially, Serdath can be difficult to connect with. He often isolates himself, avoids communicating with teammates during games, and has a tendency to abruptly delete or cut off people without explanation. He also tends to associate with extremely toxic individuals, which only reinforces his closed-off behavior. His interactions can feel cold or distant, and there’s a noticeable lack of social effort or openness toward the broader team. Tantrums or emotional outbursts are not uncommon when things don’t go his way, further straining relationships.

With genuine self-reflection, emotional maturity, and a willingness to engage with others more openly, there’s still potential for growth—not just as a player, but as a teammate and person. Until then, he may not be the best fit for those looking for a calm, collaborative team environment."</small></p>

<small>At first I really, really loved playing with <font color="#827ee9">EasyMVP</font>. His Genji was always unique and remarkable, consistently getting the job done. However, it quickly became apparent that he wasn’t a very loyal player. He preferred to join a full stack of random players rather than his long-time friends if they were just two. I have a distaste for this shameless pursuit of easy 5-man wins, as they feel cheap and meaningless—sort of like buying fake followers on social media instead of improving content quality to gain real ones, organically. Still, I will always have fond memories of our time playing together, despite him not speaking English. It never prevented us from enjoying incredibly long and fun gaming sessions together.

I often noticed that he was the only consistent, reliable player on enemy team, and everyone else was mostly a pepega. I still had my reserves, because he was playing with people I would never play with under any circustance. Now that I have him in friends, my suspicions were met - he is a reliable player, trying his best to prove his worth to his team, even if sometimes he overextends and dies silly. I cannot put it to words except to just claim that he has a positive vibes aura around him and isn’t the type to look for any drama. A joy to play with.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"harry3000 is very chill, reliable teammate to have with a positive aura about him. He primarily plays ARAMs and you would not see him chatting all that much, as he lets his playstyle do all the talking.

A happy addition to any team (as long as that team is not full of trolls and griefers)"</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Antonio0906</font> is someone I adored playing with. I found him very friendly, funny, and non-judgmental. He would cut anyone some slack and just try to enjoy HotS with "The Boys." He was always nice and kind, and talking to him always brought good vibes. He was understanding and appreciative of the circumstances, always trying to make the most of every situation. I would never see him mad, at worst case just frustrated for a second or two about something unlucky that happened in a game, and then 10 seconds later he is back to his former funny, entertaining and good-natured self. Unfortunately, I see none of that nowadays. What I see now is a shadow of my former friend who doesn’t even bother responding to simple messages, much less showing interest in playing together. If our best mutual experiences are behind us, then I’m fine with that - I can only then hope that he understands how much I valued and respected him when we did.</small></p><br>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Nítram</font> is a funny, friendly, open-minded dude with a positive attitude and I like playing with him, except when he is on the Healer role. He is extremely unreliable as a healer, because he just plays it like a tank/dps and completely forgets he has a team to take care of. For example, when he picks Lucio, he would abandon his team to play 1v9 (Reddit Lucio syndrome) and his team is left looking for heals harder than Blizzard dropped the ball with HotS. Despite his selfish playstyle, he’s undeniably entertaining. In his own words, he only plays seriously when he has to, which I respect. Most of the time, he just does things for the fun of it—like diving the enemy core while their forts and keeps are still standing (a classic).
You might have seen some banter before, but nothing compares to the back-and-forth between him and LegendaryBBQ. Their ping wars and taunts can brighten anyone’s day, and both of them are a blast to be around.
My main gripe is his double standard. He can make 50 mistakes and die 10 times without so much as a “my bad,” and no one bats an eye, noone will blame him. But if someone else dies once or slips up a single time, they immediately become the scapegoat for him. That kind of inconsistency in how he holds others accountable? Not cool.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Nitram is a fun player with a friendly attitude, and most games with him are filled with lighthearted banter and good vibes. That is—until he gets stuck playing Healer. He is selfish on any role anyway, but at that point, you might as well assume you have no Healer at all. He’s usually off doing his own thing while the rest of the team scavenges for regen globes like starving wolves.
It’s not that he can’t heal—he just clearly values his own enjoyment over keeping his teammates alive. And if there’s one role you really can’t afford to troll in ARAM, it’s the Healer… because, well, your team kind of needs one."</small></p>

<small>I don’t know how <font color="#827ee9">Xen</font> can be so intelligent and yet at the same time have some outrageous views and understandings of the game that don’t align with anyone else’s view except himself and the feeders of Silver 5. When he isn’t caught up in a cycle of dying repeatedly due to carelessness—either from his own arrogance, overconfidence, or sheer boredom—and often disregarding enemy abilities, which is a well-established side effect of 5-stacking casual matches for too long—he makes a mockery out of his own in-game stats and KDA. However, you can still appreciate his wit during better moments. He’s an amazing Fenix and Medivh player but a terrible healer (though he believes he is a great healer). I used to really enjoy playing with him, but now I don’t care as much because he’s shown me nothing but lack of care, extremely limited sociability and occasional instances of abrupt rudeness. He often feeds excessively in the games I play with him. Our last game together left such a horrible impression that it still resonates with me today, making me anxious about playing with him again. When he picks a healer or support, he fails to support effectively. He’ll even try to tank with Whitemane, claiming he does it to show his team that if he can do it, so can they. Friendly advice, my old friend: if the player base hasn’t picked up on this after three years, they probably never will. Maybe it’s best to stick with what’s already working—or just own that you’re playing casually, which is totally fine! If we’re just here to have fun, then there’s no need for heavy critiques. Anyway, we go next!</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Xen is a smart player with a unique and often unconventional approach to the game. His creative thinking can lead to unexpected plays, though at times, this style may not always work in his favor. Occasionally, his gameplay is impacted by cycles of unnecessary deaths, which can stem from overconfidence or a desire to make high-impact plays, sometimes putting the team at a disadvantage. That said, Xen’s sharp instincts are evident during his better moments—he maintains a strong kill participation rate and can be a genuine joy to play with. The healer role remains a challenge for him, as he tends to view his performance more optimistically than teammates might, occasionally overlooking key support responsibilities. Still, playing with Xen often brings fun and spontaneity to the game, even if some matches can become a bit more challenging due to his distinctive playstyle."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Novayne</font> is a fun and chill guy, and it’s always a treat when he communicates openly and is fully engaged in the experience. However, he does have "silent" periods where he disappears for a long time, or even if he is playing he says nothing. We often talk and commiserate about the depressing state of solo queue and how random trolls, griefers ruin the experience in most cases, something that happens daily, and we both understand each other’s pain. His Alarak is quite decent, supported more by tons of practice than raw mechanical skill, but there’s nothing wrong with that.

<small><font color="#827ee9">EDGYDERE</font> has changed over the years. He used to be one of my favorite people to play with, but lately, the experiences have been just okay. I am not a fan of his playstyle approach, prioritizing only his KDA and playing safely in the back, never taking any risks. While I also play safe, I do so in a calculated manner, assessing every risk. However, EDGY often plays overly safe, too cautious, which sometimes results in our team dying as four while he hugs the towers behind us. We’re a team and we should either win or die together, but nevertheless commit together. Perhaps he knowingly or unknowingly acknowledges that his mechanical skill isn’t the greatest, which is why he takes things step by step. Still, I don’t see him making any winning moves or significant contributions. It is usually the team that enables him, allowing him to shine when opportunities present themselves. The Ultimate Opportunist! I do like playing with him, I like playing with him even more when he is on comms, because maybe all he needs is a nudge in the right direction, someone to call the shots and all he has to do is follow - then it could be perfectly fine.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"At his peak, EDGY was an excellent player.

It is somewhat regrettable that he’s had history with and have been prioritizing his KDA and winrate, under the influence of certain dubious associates, rather than concentrating on cultivating meaningful relationships. Despite an aura of aloofness in which you never know which EDGY you’re going to get at any given instance, interacting with him is both enjoyable and sociable."</small></p>

Distractions can hinder his abilities, and it is beneficial to maintain a supportive environment for what is normally a very reliable player."</small></p>

<small>I can’t speak at lengths about <font color="#827ee9">Jared</font>. He is a Sylvanas main that has mastered the hero and is pretty reliable on it. Once he switches to a different hero though, it’s a whole new story and he then becomes extremely unreliable. Some games very nice, some games absolutely abysmal. But that’s alright. I enjoy playing with him, however I do not enjoy the vast majority of his friends, who are your usual suspects of 5-stack trolls, bsteppers, tauners, dancers and whatnot, so playing with him does come with its challenges. He has been gone from HotS lately as well.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Jared is a Sylvanas main, demonstrating considerable expertise with the hero. He is known for being agreeable and prioritizing game enjoyment over the size of the party, which is a commendable trait. However, he might benefit from being more mindful of social dynamics, as not everyone enjoys playing with teammates who troll and disrupt the gaming experience for their own amusement. Associating with such individuals can negatively impact your own image, afterall."</small></p>

All of the people he parties with are not only bad, but insist on ARAMing all game in Quickmatch, refusing to soak lanes or do camps - just brawl. (But you need skill for that, people!)
Still, Hrono is a very intelligent, mature, open-minded, honest and kind-hearted individual who again - is only hindered by his choice of lackluster teammates, creating one of the weakest premades I’ve encountered, we easily dismantled them several times even as a duo. While Hrono himself is a lovely dude to be around, the only other skilled player he teams up with is Selendis, who is exceptional ingame, but quite eccentric..nah, let’s not sugarcoat it - she is nuts. So in the rare occassions I get to see Hrono alone, I am very happy to have him on board for some relaxing, fun games and support his Orphea.</small></p><br>

<small>I used to love playing with <font color="#827ee9">BossGragas</font>, because even though he is a man of few words, he more than makes up for it in the skill department and he always delivered. Just like me, he doesn’t get bummed when facing a 5-stack premade team; on the contrary, he gets pumped and excited to play what he hopes will be a high-quality game. He shares my mentality of "Let’s trash these fools!" in a hyping, motivating way. During his long periods of inactivity, I was always his biggest advocate, encouraging him to come back and enjoy some games with "the boys." However, my major issue with him is his hypocrisy in his approach to the game. He plays with some of the most toxic and abusive individuals in HotS, which suggests that he isn’t doing it for the fun or camaraderie with the boys, but rather to inflate his win rate through 5-manning. </small></p><br>

With minimal communication needed, you can simply group up, queue up, and enjoy a drama-free experience, as BossGragas consistently performs well.

Despite his claims otherwise and his ridicule of those who exploit 5-stacks, he often engages in the same behavior, which comes off as hypocritical. So, unless you’re part of his toxic entourage, you probably won’t get the opportunity to play with him."</small></p>

<small>I never 5-stacked before I met <font color="#827ee9">GrumpyAlpaca</font>. It was a breath of fresh air to avoid random trolls, leavers, griefers, AFKers, and the like, allowing the game to be enjoyed as it should be—with fun and relaxation, without the burden of carrying the dead weight of intentional feeders. However, his fascination with smurfing and playing on low level accounts and making a new one when things get tough is questionable. Farming wins with a team of 5 smurfs is far from honorable and this habit has notably diminished his skill, because once he gets back to the real world and faces a real enemies that aren’t level 10-100, he gets punished heavily. He is a fun and mostly chill guy, but there is a ton of room for improvement. The breaking moment for me was, one time we lost a game as a 5-man and he blamed me for being too high level, so enemies were not low levels we can run through in under 5 minutes. As you can imagine, it is now nearly impossible for me to gain the respect I had for him back. Plus, he’s been kinda MIA, so I do not get to play with him at all anymore.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"GrumpyAlpaca is generally a relaxed and enjoyable presence, though he can be short-tempered at times. He was once a highly skilled player, but his engagement in smurfing and abusing Quick Match with low-level accounts has significantly diminished his abilities. This fascination with smurfing and farming easy wins has resulted in a notable decline in his performance, leaving him a shadow of his former self. And whenever things get rough and he starts getting normal lobbies, it is time to make a new account again. If you’re ever wondering why there aren’t many new players in HotS, because somewhere along the way when they try to level-up they meet people like Grumpy’s 5-stack of low level friends and get completely demolished."</small></p>

Storm League? Run it down! The man has no breaks, has no stop, hold or back button and will just go in, go in, go in. You know these solo queue Nazeebo, Azmodan, Raynor etc players that will just 1v9 and try to win fully by PvE/camps/pushing? Well now imagine completely the opposite. A man that tries to win by simply brawling and nothing more. As a result, this will lead to many exciting, sometimes fun, sometimes tilting situations. Playing with him isn’t always a blast—his chaotic style tends to cause more headaches than highlights. But one thing is for sure - it will never be boring.</small></p><br>

<small><font color="#827ee9">AngelGG</font> is a Spanish player who primarily participates in 5-man premades. Typically taking on the offlane role, he often plays heroes like Illidan or Malthael, soaking experience until the team needs him. At that point, he Hunts an enemy, secures a kill, and returns to soaking. While this gameplay might not be the most thrilling, it works for him, and if it brings him satisfaction, that’s all that matters. He is also not very talkative; whether this is due to language barriers is uncertain. Once, there was a misunderstanding when I asked if his heal was on cooldown and he didn’t respond. After the game, he removed me from his friends list, though I had no ill intent. Recently, like many of his teammates, he has been less active in the game.</small></p><br>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Bambini</font> has my respect for demonstrating that he can thrive without relying on 5-man premades, truly savoring the game as small size parties (duo/trio). He exhibits skills as a Lucio player, with the potential to excel even further if he didn’t attempt all the reddit Lucio plays he always keeps trying to pull. They only work against newbie players anyway. We always win vs. him unless we had some complete braindead moron in our team afking or feeding out of his mind and gifted them the win, but I can recognize experience and hero knowledge when I see them. One thing that always puzzled me back then was when we tried to invite Bambini to join our group - he seemed fun and flashy, so it made sense to include him. However, he always declined the invitations, saying 5-stacking was boring. I didn’t get it back then in 2022, but now in 2024 - I do get it. While 5-stacking can kill the fun for many players and serves mainly to avoid terrible randoms, Bambini remains unphased by these issues, which is admirable. Inspired by his example, I have found greater enjoyment in duo and trio games over 5-stacks. Thanks to Bambini for setting an admirable example!</small></p><br>

<small>As always, I’ll be frank - <font color="#827ee9">Dainty</font> isn’t my favorite teammate to play with in-game, but she is one of my favorite humans ever outside of HotS. She is a beacon of kindness and an amazing friend. I do enjoy playing with her, despite her inconsistencies, and I recognize that her teammates need to do a lot of the shot-calling out loud so she can follow, instead of just doing it in my head and expecting people to follow.

<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/50dzDTkB/medivh.png" width="32"> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ydB3Y9ht/diablo.png" width="32"> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1zDYmC8Q/garrosh.png" width="32"><br>
<small>While I’m sure <font color="#827ee9">Porky</font> is a super nice guy and means well, both his playstyle and personality can sometimes come across as a bit overbearing. I genuinely admire his commitment to the game and his eagerness to dive headfirst into teamfights—there’s no denying he brings energy. But that same aggression, when unchecked, often turns into a liability.

In his more frenzied or overconfident moments, his positioning tends to slip, and he can end up feeding in ways that really hurt the team. He’s not a bad player by any means, but there’s often a noticeable gap between the level he plays at and the level he seems to think he’s on. That overconfidence is easily his biggest weakness, and it turns most games with him into a bit of a coinflip.

It can be tough having him on the team—not because he lacks skill, but because that coin so often seems to land on the wrong side. He also has a habit of deflecting blame when things go wrong, often pointing fingers or offering excuses rather than just acknowledging mistakes or that the enemy simply played better. Sometimes, it’s not about what your teammates didn’t do—it’s about recognizing your own missteps. He never blames friends in the lobby when they misplay, but he would be quick to flame others he doesn’t know that well for way smaller mistakes. And I don’t like people with double standards.

I only remember one single HotS game with Porky on my team where he was alive when we finished. For some reason, he always seems determined to be the first one down.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Porky is a highly committed and passionate player who thrives on aggressive engagements and initiating teamfights. His dedication to the game is clear, and his willingness to lead the charge can be valuable. However, this aggressive playstyle often comes at a cost.

He has a tendency toward overconfidence, frequently diving into unfavorable situations with poor positioning, which often results in him being the first to die in teamfights. This puts his team at a significant disadvantage early in engagements and contributes to a volatile performance pattern.

Porky is known for viewing himself as a much stronger player than his performance reflects. While he’s certainly competent, his self-perception doesn’t always align with reality, and this disconnect can lead to decision-making that harms team coordination. As a result, having him on your team is often a coin toss—he can carry or completely collapse, depending on the game.

Lastly, Porky struggles with accountability. He frequently deflects blame, rarely owning his own mistakes. Instead, he’s quick to criticize teammates or justify failures by accusing enemies of "playing like cowards" when their strategy doesn’t align with his preferred playstyle. This tendency to excuse poor outcomes and shift blame is a red flag in team-based environments."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Selendis</font> is a very capable Alarak-OTP and personally is my favorite Alarak player ever to play with. Her aggressiveness played well into my book and she understood the strengths I can provide for her so we often extracted maximum value out of her Alarak. When playing against her, she appears less confident and effective than when she’s on my team. While she’s a great Alarak OTP, her quality as a friend falls short. She’s bit erratic, somewhat unhinged, with a weird/quirky sense of humor (or maybe she’s just that sadistic). Shockingly, she removed me from her friends simply for saying "GG!" after we won a match against her premade team, even though they had a clear numbers advantage. Gaining her friend request was a prolonged year-long process, while losing it was a mere instant. If she ever got fired, grab your popcorn—the PR meltdown would be legendary. She’d turn into a full-blown headline machine overnight.</small></p><br>

<small>The saying "Never meet your idols" rings true with <font color="#827ee9">Valnød</font>. After sharing some memorable and positive gaming experiences years ago, I held onto the hope of meeting him again and befriending that person as we go along. However, when we crossed paths once more, it was incredibly disappointing. He displayed cockiness, trolled throughout the match, neglected the seriousness of the game, and even ignored healing others while playing as a healer because because it’s more fun’. That encounter turned out to be one of the most unfavorable experiences I have ever endured; he was being a troll, and I was left feeling very disappointed, not at all what I remembered about him. He has the skill on other roles, but once he gets on the Healer role, you will understand what a clusterfuck clownfiesta really means. Yeah, you ain’t getting those heals.</small></p><br>

It’s disappointing to see him as a shadow of his former self, exhibiting occasional troll-like behavior."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Scorch</font> is just a Storm League ego case—mechanically competent, maybe even skilled, but completely unaware of how much his attitude drags the team down. He overextends, gets picked off, and without fail, immediately starts blaming everyone else while staying firmly convinced he’s never at fault. Of course, it’s not his fault for diving into the enemy keep while the fort is still standing—it’s yours.
And it doesn’t stop when the match ends. He might spam friend or party invites just to vent in whispers—more a reflection of his own frustrations than anything you did. It’s a classic case of a player letting ego cloud self-awareness. The best approach? Don’t take the bait. Let him send the invites if he needs to—staying calm and moving on says more about you than any post-game rant ever could."</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Scorch exhibits behavior frequently associated with toxic players in Storm League. While mechanically capable, he often lacks awareness of how his decisions negatively affect team performance—frequently overextending or mispositioning, then shifting blame rather than reflecting on his own actions. He tends to deflect responsibility by flaming teammates and maintaining an inflated sense of his own contributions. This behavior can continue beyond the match, as he may send unsolicited friend or party invites to criticize others in private. He regularly refuses to adapt strategies, dismisses feedback, and focuses disproportionately on negativity. The best approach is to remain disengaged and avoid feeding into the cycle—players that exhibit such behavior are best left ignored."</small></p>

We both want to just enjoy some HotS games, but while I wish to be a team player and do everything for my team, he is a selfish 1v9 player and will go in, dive, die, repeat, no second thoughts or care. Very reckless and careless in his ingame approach. I’m not a fan of people who Intentionally disrupting the game for personal amusement, dying 10 times then saying "top damage, bad team". He has enough game knowledge and mechanical skill to know that what he is doing is trashy and clowny, but yet that skill doesn’t excuse him from his reckless, impatient, selfish behavior. When confronted with criticism, supported by screenshot/video evidence he tends to deflect, not want to talk about it, ignore it and be passive aggressive. I wouldn’t say he is toxic, but he has so many traits that belong that same vein and it’s unfortunate. Unfortunate, because I actually enjoyed playing with him, because he showed that side of him - rude, condescending, unwilling to listen to criticism/feedback.</small></p><br>

He was always timid, quiet and not very communicative, which I respect. He seems to be back and playing again sporadically with people I haven’t seen before, who I assume are his real-life friends. However, until I see him play again or interact with some of his old acquaintances, I can’t consider him fully back; he might just be chilling/goofing around. For all we know, it could even be a different person on that account.</small></p><br>

<small>I used to really like playing with <font color="#827ee9">BillyTalent</font>. Why wouldn’t I, he’s fun and he’s got decent skills at the game. What more could I possibly ask for? However, I find his overinflated ego off-putting, especially his claims of superiority without sufficient evidence to back them up. Confidence is admirable, but his excessive and unsupported confidence is not. What truly dissuades me from considering him as a potential partner to play with is his extreme troll-like personality. His reckless and inconsiderate behavior, coupled with his tendency to react in a trollish manner to serious matters, is what ultimately turns me away. I don’t think he respects anyone, but himself. The Chinese saying "Too young, too simple" seems apt in describing him.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"BillyTalent may be a decently skilled player, but that barely matters when his entire existence in-game revolves around trolling. Young, arrogant, and utterly unserious, he plays like the match is his personal playground, regardless of how it affects the team. This is especially infuriating considering his main role is Healer—a position that requires actual teamwork and responsibility, two things he clearly has no interest in. His ego is as inflated as his claims of exceptional skill, but in reality, he’s just a massive troll. Whether it’s refusing to heal, deliberately mispositioning, or throwing just for the sake of it, his presence is more of a liability than an asset. If you’re unlucky enough to have him on your team, expect chaos, frustration, and a complete disregard for winning."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">HawaiooO</font> seizes every opportunity to belittle and criticize others while consistently exhibiting gameplay reminiscent of an intentional feeder. He preys on less experienced players in ARAM, diving deep into enemy territory while forts and towers remain intact, just to inflate his ego. This type of player is all too familiar: extremely rude and disrespectful, feeding heavily while blaming the team for not following his lead. HawaiooO exemplifies this behavior, clearly overcompensating for something. Others I could name didn’t like playing with him, simply because he was feeding so hard almost every game. I personally never minded him inting; his intentional feeding just meant more opportunities for me to shine and ultimately - more MVPs for me, and the games were still easy even with him inting. What I did mind, however, was his constant spam-pinging and rage-pinging, along with his annoying friend Lost/Winstreak/Goat with their angry teenager mentality of "Always blame the healer, unless I’m the healer". They would blame everyone else except themselves—and everyone except their German friends in the stack. Not only toxic & disrespectful, but also discriminatory.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"HawaiooO was once the embodiment of arrogance, rudeness, and reckless gameplay, but to his credit, he’s changed for the better. Where he used to belittle others and dive headfirst into enemy territory just to feed his ego, he has since improved—not just in skill, but in attitude. Now, he’s more chill and welcoming, showing actual respect toward teammates and engaging in the game with a more balanced approach. While remnants of his old playstyle might still surface from time to time, he’s no longer the same overly critical, impulsive player he once was. Instead, he’s become a solid, reliable teammate who has learned to communicate and work with others rather than against them. Growth like that is rare, and it’s refreshing to see."</small></p>

He often picks Nazeebo, focusing on achieving top siege and experience while avoiding death to farm MVPs, seemingly to impress his female gamer friends. Because in HotS if you constantly get MVPs it must mean you’re good, right? I am also not a fan of his blatant abuse of Quickmatch with toxic 5-man team compositions and his exploitation of Ranked matches by queuing with Diamond 5 players, rarely climbing on his own, even once resorting to asking the worst, most boosted account ever for help. Not a fan of his questionable companions either. Also not a fan that your chances to get a response/message drop significantly if you’re not female.

What’s worse is his constant deflecting, trolling, and belittling behavior. He may think it’s funny, but it actually comes across as inappropriate and outright bullyish.

<small>When it comes to ingame ability, <font color="#827ee9">SomeoneNew</font>’s Maiev is awesome. We’ve spent countless hours enjoying the game together, carrying 2v5 seemingly unwinnable games with his Maiev and the experience has been delightful and if anything it has taught me to never give up until its truly over. I honed my skills a lot thanks to him, for which I will forever be grateful. However, his qualities as a friend fall short. He’s quick to sever ties over differing opinions, displaying a lack of commitment to cultivating good friendships and not returning the respect you show him. He has made it clear that he’s "too chill to care". This tendency is particularly evident in his association with toxic, deceitful and/or bullyish members of windstriders, where they seem unwilling to invest any effort into fostering meaningful connections, and only get a kick when they bully, gossip, mock, bstep and ridicule outsiders or newcomers. I should know, I was one of these newcomers. All hail windstriders, the cult of Sinny and Mindhawk, the cult where if your opinion differs than that of the admins, or even if you have unconventional hero picks, you’re shunned for good. I have never before felt ostracized for being an Abathur main. Yeah, because being an Abathur main makes me such an awful person, right? So much so he actually bsteps when he sees me, when I’m just duo with a friend and he’s in a 4 or 5 stack...classy, very classy.</small></p><br>

<small>There were times when I truly enjoyed playing with <font color="#827ee9">Blademaster</font>, but he is very selective, dismissive, and downright anti-social. Interacting with him often feels like traversing a solitude-filled expanse. Any attempts I made to engage in conversation, even on the most straightforward topics, were met with silence, leaving me quite disappointed. I never had an argument or disagreement with him; it just seems that he’s set in his opinions or facts, likely influenced by "elsewhere." If you’re unconcerned with sociability and occasional inconsistent performance, then you might still have fun playing with him. However, lately, he’s been joining the most abusive, toxic stacks repeatedly using their one-trick-pony strats, achieving nothing but ruining the game for others. If you can’t beat them, join them, I guess. And this has clearly shown, as his skill level has deteriorated significantly from what I remember.</small></p><br>

<small>I met <font color="#827ee9">Raizan</font> after we faced him in a quick match game. His team performed poorly, and he was the only one putting in effort. I felt bad for him and added him afterwards, hoping to brighten his day and know he can always play with us if he wanted to. That was my mistake, as I soon realized he is a bit arrogant, without any justification. He also has a very weird sense of humor, which can make people uncomfortable—it’s just cringe. While he has good game mechanics, he is an absolute ARAM-ing offlaner, picking offlane heroes only to brawl with them. He neglects soaking and camps. He is the global ambassador of bad talent choices, which has caused us to lose otherwise easy games due to his awful talent choices, which he then persistently defends. As a result, I no longer enjoy playing with him as much.</small></p><br>

Raizan is also known for his ARAM-style play with offlane heroes, neglecting important tasks like soaking and taking camps. His stubbornness and disrespect in persistently defending these choices only make matters worse. Socially, Raizan is extremely awkward, and his unusual sense of humor can make others uncomfortable. His interactions can come across as arrogant and lacking justification. He could improve by maintaining an open perspective, avoiding provocative individuals, and seeking information firsthand through inquiry. Although his behavior detracts from the enjoyment of playing with him, his core game mechanics demonstrate his potential as a decent player."</small></p>

<small>I like <font color="#827ee9">Aramour</font> as a person, but I don’t respect his approach to the game. He has a 48% win rate solo, 45% win rate in duo queues, and an 85% win rate in 5-stack games, which I still consider a weak win rate for a 5-stack in ARAM. Relying heavily on the team will ultimately weaken a player’s individual performance. While he is friendly and considerate to his teammates whenever I’ve played with him, this doesn’t fully offset the drawbacks. When I was alone and faced their 5-stack multiple times, they played quite mediocrely. The only reason they won was due to our abysmal, griefing, and feeding randoms. We had the advantage in the early game in every single match, but they would come back once they reached level 10, as a 5-stack can coordinate much better than 5 random solo players. This highlights the downside and unfairness of matchmaking. I’m open-minded, though, and will wait to see if he can impress me or show me I was wrong about him.</small></p><br>

<small>I like <font color="#827ee9">kOry</font>, as a person. As far as I’ve seen, he has always been respectful, kind, and demonstrated great sportsmanship towards his friends. However, these positives are overshadowed by his actions that impede the experience for others. He often resorts to trolling and doesn’t take the game seriously at all. Feeding on Abathur—a hero known for not dying—and digging into the enemy team just to dance and die immediately afterward can result in clown fiestas, picking bad talents and not even hatting people. While some might find this behavior funny, it is the opposite of what I enjoy about the game. In ARAM, he is very unreliable, and you never know if he will shine or be completely useless. Despite his limited hero pool and game sense (or lack thereof), I hope others also find him to be friendly and polite in their interactions, and that he isn’t just nice to me for some reason.</small></p><br>

<small>I used to enjoy playing with <font color="#827ee9">Aumnescio</font>, but nowadays, he’s so desperate for wins that he abuses any form of 5-man stacking, including strategies like Abathur with no heals, and plays with some of the most toxic, deceitful people in the game (and he knows it), all just to gain some free, cheap, meaningless victories. Like literally you never see him anymore playing in anything but 4-5man parties, which is saddening. I know more than anyone how bad randoms are, but come on, you have to be truly desperate for fake wins to go that route. I’ve lost a lot of my respect for him—not all of it, because I still enjoyed some games with him, but we never abused, cheated, or resorted to sweatlording our draft when we played together. </small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Aumnescio is all about strategy and macro play—he’s a tryhard who takes coordination seriously and sticks to game plans like glue. That said, his success often comes from running with full 5-man stacks built around dirty, unfair comps. He tends to queue often with a tight group known for toxic behavior, which gives him an edge but definitely raises eyebrows. It’s clear he’s playing to win, but not always in the most honorable way."</small></p>

<small>I really like <font color="#827ee9">Dom</font> as a person and just as much dislike him as a player. He’s by far the most unreliable and inconsistent mid-tier player I’ve encountered. Some of his talent choices are abysmal, which is frustrating for his team because they never know if Dom will be a valuable asset or dead weight in any given game. Most of his problems, such as poor talent builds, are easy to fix, but he seems stubborn and unwilling to change, adapt, or seek advice. His unreliability and preference for extremely poor talents often result in him either intentionally feeding or playing selfishly, choosing what he wants rather than what the team needs. This lack of consideration can make him incredibly lackluster as a player. Personally, I would rather know a player will always be bad so I can adapt, instead of dealing with his unpredictability. He is too dependent on his team carrying the game, making one wonder why not just go with a random player instead. He never stands out, blending into the background as if he’s simply occupying a spot..</small></p><br>

<small>You know that meme where a guy is riding his bike, then shoves a wrench into his own front wheel, crashes, grabs his knee in pain, and immediately blames someone else? It’s the perfect representation of people who sabotage themselves but refuse to take responsibility. If there were a world record for intentionally ruining games for personal amusement, KawaiooO would hold the title without contest. The man is so unbelievably toxic that the second something goes wrong, he instinctively spams pings at his teammates. If he dies, he hate-pings the healer. If he makes a mistake, he hate-pings someone else just to make them feel guilty. He doesn’t even wait for people to mess up—he just blames them for his own screw-ups. It’s actually insane. He constantly belittles and talks down to everyone except his German friends, as if that somehow excuses his behavior. Unsurprisingly, he’s frequently silenced or suspended, always popping up on yet another fresh alt account like some kind of plague.</small></p><br>

His behavior consists of relentless insults, finger-pointing, and a constant barrage of toxic pings—often exceeding his actual gameplay contribution in sheer APM.

Instead, he fixates on scapegoating random teammates, especially newcomers who stand no chance against his relentless harassment. If he dies, it’s the healer’s fault. If he misplays, someone else must be guilty. He doesn’t just make excuses—he manufactures blame with astonishing efficiency. His toxicity is so severe that he is frequently silenced or suspended, yet always reappears on a fresh smurf account, perpetuating the cycle. With a history of unsportsmanlike conduct, disruptive gameplay, and an outright refusal to engage in fair team dynamics, he represents a prime example of behavior that should be avoided and reported."</small></p>

<small>I once thought <font color="#827ee9">Asiroy</font> was open-minded and considerate and we have had our differences in the past, but I was wrong. She takes everything too seriously and personally, and even simple facts annoy her. Twisting others’ words to make them look worse is her specialty. The last time I saw her, she and her team were sweating and struggling against three bronze players. Nice premade, I guess... I can’t solely blame them; it’s Blizzard’s matchmaking that’s at fault for pitting 3 complete newbies against 5 sweatlord tryhards on their OTP mains.

<small>I have a very fond HotS memory that includes <font color="#827ee9">TheViking</font>. We were playing in a stack, and most of our teammates had died. Everyone in voice was was spamming retreat  and saying: "Go back, go back." I was Johanna and he was Sgt. Hammer. For some reason, I decided to ignore the team’s calls; I had a feeling I could fight for a bit longer. I thought that even if I died, it would buy some time and Hammer would definitely escape. In an incredible turn of events, we managed to turn the fight around, 2v5, with a bit of 3v5 help at the end. We defeated half of the enemy team and both survived and shortly after won the game. It just felt good, it just felt right. Socially, he has always been a bit reserved, but I respected that he kept to himself and didn’t mess around. I understood we wouldn’t exchange Christmas cards or become best friends, but I hoped he saw me as a reliable teammate, just as I saw him. However, that changed after one disappointing ARAM match, where he died 12 times on Garrosh, essentially causing us to lose. Not entirely his fault, there were other reasons, like enemy draft comp and scaling was much better than ours into the late game, but still - he did not help us maintain advantage. He immediately turned to blame me (Malfurion) for the loss, despite me having a solid performance and doubling the healing of the enemy healer. He criticized my talent choices without any valid reason or defense. When I told him he was delusional if he thought I was the cause of the loss or any of my talents were to blame, he snapped and removed me from his friends list. He refused to communicate further or discuss it, even though there were several attempts on my part. I told him that 1 bad game doesn’t define us, but he was very clear and adamant in saying, "I’m not your friend, never was." Oh well, if they don’t respect you in return, just move on. Nothing of value was lost anyway.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"It’s truly disheartening that a player of considerable skill harbors such a toxic disposition and a reluctance to engage in communication to resolve conflicts.

When confronted with a differing viewpoint, their response escalated into an intense and highly negative tirade. That incident serves as a reminder of the consequences of unchecked emotions and an unwillingness to engage in constructive dialogue."</small></p>

<small>What do you say to people when they try to teach you (was it called backseating?) on your own best heroes? This is not sarcasm, I’m genuinely asking, because <font color="#827ee9">LinK</font> did that to me often. He always questions other people’s talents, even when he has the worst stats and has contributed the least in the same game he criticizes. He is so close-minded that he doesn’t stop to consider for a second that he might be out of his league. He is very dependent on his team to perform, which is a sad fact ot know about a person who mains Kerrigan, a hero that should be played to be dominant and opportunistic. It is sad that he displays such a delusional perspective on some things. If he never wrote anything in team chat, he would be a much better teammate than he is right now, making himself his own biggest enemy. My "journey" with him ended (thank god) when once I was staying in Hero Select afk and he attempted to invite me. I told him I did not want to join because that group of people weren’t exactly my favorites. I had every intention of playing with him later when the group included more sociable, friendly people. After less than a minute, he started flaming me, going on a full rant: "man, why u always do this? you just ruined the party. everyone left because you didn’t join, not enough people because of you, you prefer going solo, but you don’t want to join this group" I responded, "I’m sorry, am I not allowed to choose who I play with?" and he deleted me instantly afterwards. LOL!</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"LinK displays an extraordinary lack of cooperation, often appearing entirely self-absorbed and maintaining a delusional perspective on certain matters. Regarding his ingame capabilities, he fall within the "OK" range—not subpar yet not outstanding. It would be crucial for him to grasp the notion that his own limitations in a specific aspect do not equate to the same limitations for others. Recognizing that others might excel where he struggles is an essential lesson he should internalize and also lower down his toxicity levels."</small></p>

<small>"God is my witness" that I’ve really tried my best and hardest to like and come to terms with <font color="#827ee9">VentedSun</font>, but he made it an impossible mission with his words and behavior. It was fun at the beginning, he was inclusive, inviting and his voice sounded like "a nice dude", but that is where the positives end. He has a giga-inflated view of himself, yet he is often completely oblivious about what is happening around him. He will always downplay and water down his teammates’ contributions and inflate his own. He confused me a lot by created friction between people by talking bad stuff about them behind their backs, (I’m sure he’s done the same for me behind my back) but when those same people he tried to turn me against were in voice he was nice and friendly to them. An example would be ridiculing and making fun of MarlKarcs in Storm League, but when that player was with us, VentedSun had only praise and agreeable exchanges with him. That is hypocrisy 1on1 and I would never be okay with it. The last time we played together, I had been enjoying a duoqueue lossless streak as Thrall, he came in and we lost 3 games in a row thanks to his low-impact Medivh. And what did he do? He blamed the Thrall of course. Once upon a gaming session, he was just belittling me and my contributions, while ignoring all the saves and cleanses I did for him. So a couple of games later when I left his party to join another, he would message me in "surprise pikachu face" that I left, treating it as almost treason for joining someone else. Last but not least, he would always share clips of "cool things he did", but you could easily compile ten times as many instances of his mistakes, failures, and outright embarrassments. Why do we never see those, I wonder? So if you’re a fan of edgelords, off-color jokes, your typical quickmatch bstepper/taunting enemies while in a 5 stack, someone who needs 2 full-time job Healers to keep him alive from his inting attempts and someone consistently attempting to belittle, mock, blame and gossip about others for their own amusement then go for it, just not my cup of tea.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"VentedSun is a player who frequently takes unnecessary risks due to overestimating his own abilities. He often treats teammates (and opponents) with a lack of respect, ignoring or belittling their ideas and contributions. He sometimes tries to turn others against his teammates, while remaining completely oblivious to what is going on in the game. If this behavior aligns with what you’re seeking, VentedSun is the player for you."</small></p>

<small>I find that <font color="#827ee9">BATEMAN</font> is highly aggressive but lacks strategic calculation. He tends to charge forward without much thought, placing unnecessary pressure on the rest of the team and forcing them to either forfeit a fight, engage in a disadvantageous team fight, or play around him when he is out of position, which is often. As a result, BAITMAN frequently creates more challenges for the team due to his reckless playstyle and rarely makes game-winning contributions.

<small>Unfortunately, my only story with <font color="#827ee9">purplepurple</font> is not a very good one. We were playing together, just the two of us in ARAM—he was Brightwing, and I was Falstad. I was having a banger of a game, and it seemed easy. Until late game, when things got tough. To avoid risk and secure the win with the enemy core being quite low, I asked him to teleport to me after I flew to it. Of course, I flew there, and he didn’t teleport and I died with somewhere betwen 18-21% core, don’t remember specifically. I know he had Z active because I am a Brightwing main and can tell when it’s available. He simply chose to ignore me, and we subsequently lost, embarrassingly throwing such an easy game. You can imagine how disappointed I was because I had to learn the hard way that he is an unreliable teammate who wouldn’t listen to calls needed to win, playing only for his own amusement. My respect for him flew out the window. Feel free to think I’m being harsh, but if he had just teleported to me, and we still died and lost, then I would’ve been fine—at least we tried together. It’s the unreliability that bugs me.</small></p><br>

Despite these shortcomings, he is still somewhat better than a random player, as his skills and game knowledge can occasionally make up for his self-centered approach. However, his tendency to prioritize personal enjoyment over team success, combined with the fact of his in-game lag issues consistently undermines his potential to be a truly valuable teammate."</small></p>

<small>I don’t understand <font color="#827ee9">phish</font>’s fascination with trolling and making games harder than they should be. If he’s bored, he should just stop playing HotS. I’ve called him out on his behavior, and since then, he hates me more than ice cream hates the sun. Nowadays, when he sees me, he calls me Silver or Gold or whatever + other namecalling. It’s as if his best comeback to factual evidence is to dismiss it with "nuh-uh, u bad, u gold." There’s simply no arguing with such a delusional persona, even if you have the best intentions. I just wanted him to acknowledge his mistake that cost us the game, I was willing to meet him half-way, but instead, he remains impervious to any criticism and even close to 2 years later he is still as disrespectful and stubborn.

<small><font color="#827ee9">Woodganyr</font> is a toxic individual and frequently shows it, despite always playing in a 5-stack. I don’t even know where all that hostility and toxicity come from. Actually, I believe I do—another Dunning-Kruger victim, ImpactInter, apparently said some nasty things about me to him. Without even confronting or talking to me about it, Woodganyr started being toxic towards me based on the comments made. A long time ago, when he had me added from another account but didn’t know it was me, he would add and invite me without any issues. However, when he learned it was me, he reverted to his toxic self again. This sudden shift in behavior was confusing and unwarranted. I have only tried my best in his games and haven’t griefed or trolled, yet he treats me with nothing but hostility, toxicity and disrespect. I don’t hate him; I’m more puzzled by the negativity directed at me. I’ve always strived to contribute positively in his games, so his behavior feels unjustified. But whatever, I don’t need to know or care, because I see him for what he truly is—a toxic, condescending, rude nolifer. Imagine the audacity you must have to play exclusively in full premade groups and yet try to DM (whisper) the enemies who were solo or duo afterward to flame and belittle them, acting tough because you just beat them as a 5-man in ARAM of all places... B-stepping and taunting while in a 5-man? Come on, what are you compensating for, keyboard warrior? It’s disheartening to see someone go out of their way to spread negativity, especially when they have the advantage of a coordinated team. This behavior speaks volumes about his character and attitude, and it’s clear that his toxic attitude extends beyond just the game. Guess it is one of the side effects of playing with BPRaiku and other toxic assholes for so long, you become a self-centered, egomaniacal, cocky little shit. Zeig mir deine Freunde und ich sag dir wer du bist. So kindly fuck off Woodganyr, you toxic little cunt!<br></small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Woodganyr is known for his toxic behavior, frequently using insults and derogatory remarks to belittle, taunt, or harass other players. Despite always playing in a coordinated 5-stack team, he often directs unwarranted hostility toward others, influenced by his own close-mindedness and gullibility. He is also rude, selfish, arrogant, and overconfident, thinking he’s better than anyone else and believing he has the right to taunt and belittle others. Additionally, Woodganyr’s actions extend beyond mere in-game strategy. He engages in taunting and flaming enemies through direct messages after matches, often acting tough, taunting, bstepping, dancing enemies, despite having the advantage of a full premade group. This consistent pattern of negativity and condescension speaks volumes about his character, indicating a deeper, pervasive toxic attitude."</small></p>

<small>I was exposed to <font color="#827ee9">SamDovl</font> for a little bit. He is a Chromie OTP and is generally a good Chromie player. However, after one game where he repeatedly disrespected the opponents by overextending, dying more than necessary, and putting others on his team (mainly me, trying to save him) in danger, despite my repeated warnings and asking him kindly to stop trying his best to int, I was done playing. I cannot respect such careless, reckless behavior, especially when it endangers your healer due to your own mistakes. However, it didn’t stop there. Instead of just saying "yeah, sorry, I will play safer next time" or simply "my bad, sorry," he doubled down and went into full angry whining teenager mode. At that point, I wasn’t just done playing that particular game session; I was done with him, period. I haven’t played with him since, but I know he’s now part of the toxic 5-man Abathur no-heal abuse stack. Good for him, I guess—finally a way for him to earn some wins ;)</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"A player who, even after investing significant time in playing a single hero(Chromie) struggles to understand their own limitations and boundaries. Consequently, he frequently overextends, being careless and inadvertently putting undue stress on his teammates nearly every game. Teflon to feedback, when advised to adopt a more cautious or strategic approach, they throw a tantrum in response - a common issue in the gaming community, reflecting the entitlement sometimes seen among players. Recently he has been abusing 5-man abathur no heal no tank comps, which may be the only way for them to get any wins. For all those reasons - SamDovl is not recommended as a potential teammate."</small></p>

<small>While a healthy dose of banter and camaraderie is essential for nurturing meaningful friendships both online and in the real world, <font color="#827ee9">Gladius</font> tends to push the boundaries excessively, crossing into outright bullying and displaying remarkably toxic behavior towards others in the process. He possesses and openly demonstrates an extreme superiority complex—everything he chooses is right and everything you choose is wrong. There is no argument or meaningful conversation; it is simply blaming, flaming, and the occasional rage quitting. Additionally, he thinks he is cool and funny by making racist, sexist, and homophobic jokes, which is far from commendable. 
At least one positive outcome emerged from his actions—this entire player list, both objective and subjective, was created to counter his biased tier list. His original list unfairly condemned those he disagreed with or disliked while placing all his friends at the top. It is a shame because this extremely toxic and repetitive behavior completely overshadows the fact that he is actually decent at the game."<br/><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HkbfSMsv/jkekw.png"><br/>nice aram build btw.</small></p><br>

<small>The total number of games I have with <font color="#827ee9">witchet</font> could be counted on the fingers of both hands, and he has always been and done the same - feeding out of his mind. He is feeding as if each death awarded you $100. When everyone else is 0 deaths, he is 5. When everyone else has 1 death, he has 8. Most recently, there were 4 enemies bot and he somehow died as Genji top. HOW?! It happens to all of us occasionally, but to be consistently top in deaths in every game of a select sample size shows a pure and annoying lack of care and disrespect for both teammates and opponents. His total disregard for the team and his role in it makes him an extreme, game-sabotaging liability. His reckless actions make playing with him absolutely unbearable for me. I cannot confirm if he behaves the same way in StormLeague, but I don’t even care if there is some skill hidden underneath all that awful behavior and he is just trolling. After such disappointing experiences  and a bad first impression as a result of him feeding too extra, it simply isn’t fun to play with him. I mean I killed his Hogger with an aba hat on a minion..."</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"witchet is often more of a detriment than a benefit to his team. He consistently underestimates opponents, leading to reckless plays and frequent feeding—and more than anything, it’s his carelessness that costs games. Unsurprisingly, his in-game metrics—especially his abysmal KDA—fall well below the average for his skill bracket. What’s even more frustrating is his tendency to ignore team calls and suggestions, no matter how respectfully they’re delivered. Instead, he sticks to his own 1v9 playstyle, completely disregarding the team’s needs. But do not worry, as his 9k Friend will boost him right back up."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">WMongrel</font> is, plain and simple, not a good person. He acts like he is a great player (which he is not) and a wise man (which he is definitely not), trying to appear as a parental-figure to others he plays with, but he is close-minded and unwilling to even consider differing viewpoints, even on simple matters like which talent to choose for Tyrande at level 4. All he does with his arguments and trying to prove a point is appear conceited and patronizing. He believes he is right about everything he raises his voice about and uses mental gymnastics to gaslight and manipulate the conversation, deceitfully twisting what was said and what actually happened to fit his narrative (and perhaps feel better about himself in the process). That’s dishonesty 101, and I’m sure if he chooses to, he will have a great future in political news coverage. The last time we played together, I was playing Morales and I had full HP, full energy and I was asking why is our Zagara so afraid of going in and dealing damage in the teamfight (mind you Zagara was broken OP back then), that I was ready to pocket her and save her if needed. I wasn’t even flaming or anything, I was encouraging team to go in and deal damage. The only front we had was doing his job, but our DPS wasn’t. We won the game, but it could’ve been much easier. So afterwards he was upset that I was upset and deleted me and refused to play with me after. Even out of pure kinship, I tried to meet him in the middle, for the sake of our mutual friends, but he wouldn’t have it. He expected me to beg for forgiveness and admit he was right, even when he absolutely wasn’t. Since then, I’ve trashed their 5-man stack multiple times when we faced them, so whatever—karma knows best :) Nothing of value was lost anyway.</small></p><br>

It’s as if we’ve taken a trip back to 2003 when MOBAs were on the rise and all the angry kids were saying, "1v1 me mid bro." Even the slightest, mildest comment or question can cause him to tilt, especially when he’s dead. Once, I asked him if he found value in the level 20 Ultralisk upgrade on Kerrigan. I was genuinely curious because I rarely see others use it, but we won the game because he had it, and it provided just enough damage to finish the core and secure the win. I complimented him, but he interpreted it as an insult, as if I were challenging or questioning his skills. This led to a tantrum on his part, including a burst of rage and cringe-worthy, medically-themed insults, which he reportedly uses because of his profession. I sincerely hope for the well-being of his patients. <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qqWTq2hn/prayge.png" width="32"><br>I wouldn’t want to put my health and well-being into the hands of a doctor who is so toxic and delusional in real life. </small></p><br>

Furthermore, she’s extremely gullible, readily accepting every word without seeking proof, and quick to lash out with insults, harassing people who have nothing to do with her dramas with baseless accusations. She has come to me numerous times to ask why I have spoken badly about her, despite the fact that it was entirely untrue. By that point, I had lost contact with her for a long time, and she knows I am easy to reach. Yet she always starts with insults and baseless accusations. She needs to understand that she is not the center of the world and not everyone is out to get her. I may be the only person she’s played with who hasn’t hit on her, so that could be part of the reason why there’s friction.

It’s pivotal for him to grasp the idea that his personal limitations in a specific area shouldn’t be generalized to others. Understanding that others can excel where he struggles is a vital lesson he needs to give some thought to. Plus, constantly making racist, sexist and homophobic jokes doesn’t contribute to anyone’s positive image."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">WickedCheese</font> is the true definition of an angry, self-obsessed man-child. His behavior is a perfect example of someone who is both delusional and toxic. I’ve seen him ragequit from matches over the most trivial things—whether it’s because he died once, the team picked a healer, or they didn’t follow him into a reckless engage. Frequently blaming others for mistakes or losses, he’ll ragequit for no apparent reason at all when you least expect it. Before leaving, he has this irritating habit of typing "Enjoy AI uwu" in the chat, a parting shot that only highlights his lack of maturity. He constantly blames others for his own failures and never shows any remorse for his disruptive behavior. He’s been permanently banned on several accounts due to his toxic actions, but it’s clear that he’s still out there poisoning the community. He’s probably operating under a new, unidentified account, farming bans and suspensions faster than Vikings farm XP. he is a ticking time bomb and his presence is a persistent problem, and it’s incredibly frustrating to deal with, because you never know when he is about to explode and leave you with an underwhelming AI.<br>If, by some unfortunate twist of fate, you end up on his team, avoid picking a healer. Doing so significantly increases the likelihood of him griefing and ragequitting.</small></p><br>

<small>I’m not criticizing <font color="#827ee9">angela</font> for opting to exclusively play Abathur in QM, as I always say that I have no problem with One-trick players - but why for goodness’ sake you have to abuse the most toxic comps ever imaginable, Abathur+4 self-sustain assassins/bruisers, without Healer or Tank as a 5 stack (even on subpar players) ensuring that you will hardly ever face decent enemies, as no respectable stack will play without a healer or tank, getting cheap, meaningless wins in the process to boost your already fragile ego? Preying on unsuspecting solo randoms just ruins the experience for others and it is a coin toss between him and BPRaiku as to which one of them made more people abandon and uninstall Heroes of the Storm. So yes, while it’s legal to use the resources that are available in the game and is possible, it is obviously just shameless, blatant abuse of matchmaking and pandering to themselves. It seems angela’s already fragile ego can’t take a hit, due to him not being able to take a loss without losing temper or gossip about people. He seems to feel extremely proud to BARELY win versus solo or duo players as a 5 stack. Surely single-handedly being responsible for greatly declining the quality of life of QM is all worth it. Just let them be! Let the kid have his moment. How else would they be able to win a game?!</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br> With respect to all one-trick players in this tierlist - angela raises concerns about the use of highly unbalanced compositions, specifically Abathur combined with four self-sustaining assassins or bruisers, without a healer or tank, in a 5-stack. This strategy results in facing weaker opponents, as respectable teams typically include a healer or tank, leading to easy, unfulfilling victories that seemingly serve to inflate angela and his friends’ egos. This approach, preying on solo random players and always canceling the search if another 5-man team is detected to avoid facing good teams, detracts from the enjoyment of others and contributes to the decline in the quality of Quick Match games. Additionally, he has shown that he cannot handle losses gracefully and often resorts to gossiping, losing his temper, and threatening to kick and never invite some of their less-abusive party members again. Despite the legality of this strategy within the game’s mechanics, it is seen as a blatant abuse of matchmaking, aimed at securing hollow victories."</small></p>

<small>Although I appreciate his time investment in the HotS scene and his social activity, I cannot under any circumstances recommend <font color="#827ee9">Elitesparkle</font> as a good potential teammate. Unfortunately, he is an underwhelming player, whose stats and performance consistently falls below the expected standard. On paper, one might assume he possesses above-average skills, considering his role in creating guides for others. Nevertheless, when it comes to actual gameplay, he proves to be an unreliable teammate, failing to meet expectations.
I have played a few games with him, and he never performed his role as a tank properly, despite being a tank main. He always exhibited noticeable reluctance to protect and create space for the team, almost always engaging in his own 1v9 scenarios. He would often solo soak as ETC or Diablo instead of tanking. If he wants to soak, he should just pick a solo laner. When met with criticism, he reacts immaturely, like a child throwing a tantrum. He never stops to consider that he might be wrong, that his team actually needs their tank, and that most of his rotations have incredibly bad timing.
Moreover, some of the builds he has written and strongly recommends to the community are laughably bad, hurting the community more than helping. Players who follow his underwhelming talents and builds will come to your games and perform poorly, just like him. A for effort. F for execution.</small></p><br>

Unfortunately, whatever he says always comes out wrong or awkward, yet he remains confident about it. He often posts and talks about topics that nobody cares about or asked for. For example, imagine you’re playing a game with friends, and suddenly, a non-English speaker starts talking about how they hacked a torrent website or other irrelevant subjects that nobody cares about and that are not related at all. Imagine you’re playing with the boys and someone says in party chat "the red horse has closed the refrigerator, because my elephant tears drive a scooter". I wish I was kidding, but no - that’s how absurd and inadequate some of his text is. I don’t know, might be some super-advanced AI being taught to mix with humans and play with them.

Although I’ve never witnessed it firsthand, several different sources, who don’t know each other, have told me the same thing: if someone is underperforming, Dyløs is quick to suggest they get kicked from the group and not be welcomed back.

<small>In my experience, <font color="#827ee9">Jypyx</font> is a player whose in-game performance metrics consistently fall below the generally accepted average for the skill level he competes in within his party sizes. He demonstrates a poor KDA record, which indicates a tendency toward recklessness. His high death rate suggests he often engages in battles without proper consideration of the risks involved. This tendency to "feed" the enemy team by dying frequently makes him a liability rather than an asset. Furthermore, his positioning is often subpar, putting him and his team at a disadvantage during critical moments. His unreliability as a teammate stems from these shortcomings, as well as his inconsistent decision-making in-game. These factors combined make him a less desirable player to team up with, as they negatively impact the overall team performance and cohesion.</small></p><br>

<small><font color="#827ee9">MytiC</font> is without a doubt one of the most dreadful, toxic and deceitful human beings I’ve ever had the misfortune to experience first-hand. Soon after I returned to HotS, I met him randomly by playing against their 5-stack and afterwards I started joining them often, just happy to have a group to play with. I had no idea who he was or what he’d done. It didn’t take long before people raising their eyebrows at me with "Do you know who he is?" "Do you know what he’s done?" and although it got me curious, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, because I didn’t see any proof, just empty accusations. Sadly, when I actually got to know more about him and be in his inner circle for awhile, I found out that the rumors out there, are if anything - watered down. He is actually much much worse than people claim to be and I’ve seen him/heard him/proved he’s done terrible, deceitful, manipulative, downright inhumane things here in  this community. I’m just sorry it took me this long to realize he’s such a toxic, irredeemable cunt, that will leave the party as soon as he sees an opening in a more stacked one. I’ll share just one Raiku story - He had a Russian Discord fan club where most members believed he was a legitimate GM#1. They often teased him about why he never played Storm League and only streamed Quick Match and ARAM. After persistent teasing, he finally agreed to play. He launched HotS, started streaming on Discord, but did not log in to his main account. Instead, he used a Diamond 5/4 smurf, queued for a game, and got into Tomb of the Spider Queen. He picked Ragnaros, then died three times in two minutes and twenty seconds, blamed and flamed his entire team, and rage-quit, closing the stream. He hid in shame for the rest of the day and didn’t talk to anyone. Yet, to this day, his ego remains sky-high.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"The epitome of a toxic, appalling and most harmful hypocrite you might encounter not just in HotS, but on any online platform. Engaging in wintrading, rank exploiting, manipulating 3rd party website stats to appear higher in the leaderboards, getting boosted and shamelessly manipulating and deceiving others. He cloaks himself in a nice facade, while plotting to sow discord, fuel drama, and incite conflict among peers and harass people from multiple alt accounts. He never wants to face another 5-stack and dodges search until his friends find a game. When faced by decent players, the reasons for his abusive quickmatch/aram 5-man spamming becomes all the more obvious. At this point he’s turned even those closest to him against him. Question everything he says and stay away if you know what’s good for you."</small></p>

<small>Whenever I’ve tried to give <font color="#827ee9">Johnny</font> helpful advice or feedback, he has negatively rejected it and taken it personally. It all started when he showed me Hanamura replay and expected me to agree with him about why they lost, but I maintained that both sides arguing were wrong. His self-centeredness prevents him from realizing how detrimental his actions are to the team and how his constant feeding and underestimating the opponents have lost him more games than the "bad teammates" he blames. I always hoped he would change, lose his egotistical arrogance, selfishness and negativity. I dismissed/disregarded most of the toxicity he showed and gave him multiple chances to change, to grow, to show that his immature old mistakes do not define him, hoping he would eventually see the error of his ways, apologize, and move on. He never said sorry or simply "my bad". My personal favorite one though is that he told me twice in the past that "athleticBird wasn’t that good of a player" or "is just ok", yet nowadays he wants to squeeze within athleticBird’s group daily. His extreme arrogance aside, his social skills are not a highlight either. He constantly badmouths people (even those he plays with), shows hostility, and acts hypocritically—flaming someone and swearing he’ll never play with them again, only to team up with them the next day. According to him, he is never wrong; it’s always someone else’s fault. He manipulates facts and refuses to show any remorse for his words or actions, never apologizing even when he has clearly made a mistake. He is at his zone, whenever he is running it down and feeding out of his mind. When agitated, he will grief and throw a game to make a point—though what point, I wonder... After I told him I was done with him because of his behavior, he even named his account after me. How adorable.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"A clear case of the Dunning-Kruger effect, this person exhibits delusional tendencies and toxicity, as he consistently overestimates his abilities, inadvertently becoming his own greatest adversary. Instead of embracing constructive criticism, he would react negatively, interpreting it personally. Has the proclivity of displaying textbook griefing or intentionally throwing a game as his way of throwing a fit, a trait that is inexcusable. And as a result, he will find ways to deflect and blame others as motive, demonstrating an utter lack of accountability or remorse for his actions. His extreme inconsideration further compounds his shortcomings. Despite the potential for significant personal growth, his close-mindedness, arrogance, selfishness, lack of respect, underestimating and disrespecting the opponents and constantly dying for no reason, constantly badmouthing his "friends" behind their back and poor self-awareness have thwarted many attempts at redemption and improvement over more than 3 years."</small></p>

<small>I can use only two words to perfectly describe <font color="#827ee9">SKTT1MaRin</font>: Simp. Troll. If there’s a female in the party, he loses his mind. All gamer girls want to be with him, and all his party mates try to steal his e-girls. He sows discord and lies to these girls about what others said or did in an attempt to gain favor with them. "Lipstick and I have romantic feelings, so stop talking to her" — his words, not mine. How delusional can one be to do or say such things? In-game, he is as unreliable and tedious to deal with as they come. When he almost always trolls and feeds, dying alone right before objectives spawn, and is confronted with "Why did you go 1v5 there? Why didn’t you wait for us?" he replies, "It wasn’t 1v5, it was 1v4!" Gee, thanks for the correction! An extremely immature and delusional kid, his behavior overshadows the fact that he actually has a decent understanding of the game.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"A humorous yet reckless individual, he often complicates group dynamics with his tendency to lose focus and simp around women.

In-game, he frequently trolls and engages in reckless behavior, yet when confronted, he defiantly downplays the severity of his actions, humorously dismissing his intentional feeding."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">OkUpA</font> is fundamentally disconnected from reality, operating within his own narrow perspective that fails to grasp the broader dynamics of the game. His understanding is severely limited, and he often speaks authoritatively on topics about which he has little knowledge, while never ever playing solo and only playing in a 5-man stack. This lack of comprehension leads him to make unfounded claims and express opinions that lack substance. If he happens to get a Win against you while playing in a full 5-man team against your solo/duo efforts, he tends to exaggerate the significance of the victory and claim that "they trashed you". He eagerly embellishes the narrative to inflate his and his team’s quite mediocre achievement, broadcasting their success and self-congratulating with an inflated sense of pride. Yeah, congrats man, you just barely survived as 5-stack vs duo and 3 feeding, useless bots. Congratufuckinglations! You did it! The best thing you ever did in your life.

<small><font color="#827ee9">FrankieFix</font> is a mid-skill, underwhelming pubstomper, almost exlusively playing in large (4/5-man) groups. To contrast, his solo win rate is 49%, but it rises to over 81% in a 5-man group. His in-game performance metrics fall below the expected average for his peers, indicating poor skill or recklessness, or both. In my limited experience playing with him, he consistently overextended and fed in every match. At least he was somewhat polite when advised to play more cautiously, a trait that is rare currently in HotS players. Glass cannon heroes like Valla and Orphea require a good understanding of their limits and positioning, which he lacks, making him an extremely unreliable teammate.

<small>I am not a fan of "E" build Samuro, however the one thing that build is good for - is making you unkillable. You shouldn’t die when you’re E-build Samuro. Well <font color="#827ee9">Venomspit</font> is a 999-level Samuro player with "E" build and he’s constantly dying. I don’t know how he does it, it’s actually impressive he manages to die so much after such long exposure to the hero. Unfortunately, because of his poor positioning and unreliability, I cannot find a good reason to team up with him. Some people tell me he can be toxic too, but I haven’t seen that myself so I can’t comment.</small></p><br>

<small>I’ll give anyone a break who comes from NA to play on EU servers. Knowing they lag, I empathize with them and only wish them good things, hoping they enjoy their stay. However, <font color="#827ee9">Letgo</font> is a tough case to crack. For me personally, one of the most off-putting things in video games is when an individual with significantly lower skill incessantly pings, makes remarks, and questions players who possess a much greater understanding of the game, even daring to challenge their builds, playstyle, and knowledge. 
If Letgo would just play quietly without trying to act tough or cool, he would have no faults. His gameplay skills are acceptable, and he could always use the "lag" excuse if he underperforms, given that playing on EU servers from NA can indeed cause latency issues. This would make his presence more tolerable and potentially even enjoyable for others. However, his constant need to assert himself, coupled with his lower skill level, disrupts the team’s dynamics and enjoyment of the game (or at least my part of it). His incessant pinging, remarks, and unwarranted criticism of more skilled players create a toxic atmosphere, undermining team cohesion and morale. For these reasons, I cannot recommend or enjoy playing with him. His behavior overshadows any potential he might have as a teammate, making him a less desirable choice to play together.</small></p><br>

At first, he appeared to be just like any other OTP, always picking his own hero and never playing anything else. However, he was patient and quiet only in high-skill lobbies, where the games were free and easy. It became evident that he is extremely toxic when he’s in more typical parties or smaller group sizes, as he would blame and deflect onto others. His playstyle is to AFK soak until he sees an opening for "The Hunt," then hunt and go back to soaking. This makes him about as passive and careful as Illidans can get. Additionally, he was the first person ever to be banned on HeroesProfile for manipulating wins by uploading only his victories, resulting in a 90% win rate on the website, while his in-game stats were actually in the 60% range. Personally I haven’t seen him in awhile.</small></p><br>

<small>A common theme you’ll find in Storm League (and HotS in general) is players vastly overestimating their abilities and diving in on cooldown without any thought process—just charging straight ahead brainlessly. As a result, they end up feeding the enemies more opportunities. <font color="#827ee9">dudemanguy</font> is a prime example of this. If you encounter him in your game, he’ll most likely pick Qhira and int on cooldown, easily racking up 7-9 deaths. The good thing I will say is that at least he doesn’t flame as much as others, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t a huge detriment to his team, often throwing away the hard-earned advantage the team secured, with or without his help. I strongly advise you to pick Zarya or Medivh if he’s on your team; he will definitely need it. And do not waste Anduin pull on him - he will go straight back in regardless. Just use him as a human shield and do your best! It’s not impossible to play around an inting, braindead player like him, and I still try my best when I get him on my team. If anything, it gives me even more opportunities to shine. </small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"In Storm League, a recurring issue is players who overestimate their abilities and dive in on cooldown without any real strategy, leading to frequent feeding.

While he isn’t particularly toxic and refrains from flaming his teammates, his complete disregard of what his deaths do, his gameplay tends to be a significant drawback, often jeopardizing the hard-earned advantages his team has secured. If dudemanguy is on your team, it’s advisable to pick heroes like Zarya or Medivh to help mitigate the impact of his risky playstyle.

His low skill level is bad enough, but it’s his arrogance that truly grates on me. He always insists it wasn’t his fault and believes he isn’t the weakest link, yet in most cases, he undeniably is. I’d much rather trust matchmaking to provide a random teammate; at least a random player might surprise me, whereas Mo18 never does—he always underperforms. By underperforming, I mean he dies at the most unfortunate times, leaving the team at a significant disadvantage. If he doesn’t care about improving his own gameplay, that’s one thing, but he should at least respect his teammates’ time and effort. He doesn’t even ask for advice or help on how to perform better or what builds to go for, confirming his arrogance that he believes he isn’t doing anything wrong. It’s okay to be bad, but what’s not okay is to be bad and be delusional that you aren’t the one that is dragging the team down.</small></p><br>

Additionally, his behavior is often disrespectful, further detracting from team dynamics. With some of the lowest KDA and KDR statistics on record and poor situational awareness, MO18 demonstrates a notable lack of focus and reliability. Based on these metrics, opting for a random player may yield better results in terms of competence and teamwork."</small></p>

<small>The Man, the Myth, the <font color="#827ee9">Fabled</font>. I’ve heard many legendary tales about him (from his victims, aka teammates), but none of them truly capture the essence of this guy—you have to see it to believe it. Our very first game together, he managed to die six times in three minutes as Butcher. He’s completely unhinged, even making the calmest, nicest teammates lose their cool and flame him. Across the entire player list, there isn’t a single person with worse KDR/KDA stats in StormLeague. And yet, I refuse to believe anyone can actually be that bad. No, he’s just an absolute buffoon of an inter, a total liability to the team, and I will forever have PTSD from I seeing his name loading up on my team. Unlucky ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"If you find yourself in a ranked game with Fabled, it may be a challenging experience. His playstyle is often aggressive and risky, which can lead to poor outcomes. Known for a "shoot first, ask questions later" approach, Fabled’s performance is inconsistent, and he tends to have one of the lowest KDA and positioning stats among ranked players. To mitigate this, drafting supportive heroes like Medivh or Zarya can help minimize the impact of his high-risk gameplay, although that won’t guarantee a better experience. With Fabled on your side, prepare for the worst and hope for the best."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Omega</font> is by far the most unreliable teammate in ARAM, and unfortunately, not for the reasons one might expect. There are worse players than him, much worse, skill-wise. However, what sets him back even further is his total inconsideration and arrogance. He would try to defend indefensible choices, saying things like, "Hey, I don’t have to pick Heal, right? I’ll play Murky, Murky is OP." - and then lose the game 4 minutes later. He is completely delusional about what is needed and always thinks it’s all about him, believing he is the king of ARAMs. If something goes wrong, it’s never his fault; it’s always the team’s fault. This makes him one of the worst teammates I’ve ever had to deal with.
I would rather have someone who is simply bad but respectful, or even someone toxic, as long as they aren’t a game or draft ruiner like Omega. I wouldn’t be caught dead playing with him ever again.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"While Omega may initially appear to be an average to decent teammate, a closer examination reveals significant issues that hinder team success. His gameplay often lacks any remarkable or noteworthy contributions, and he frequently disrupts team composition with questionable choices. Omega’s inflated ego compounds these problems, as he consistently overestimates his own abilities. Despite his belief in his superior skill, his performance fails to align with these self-perceptions. An additional point of concern is Omega’s tendency to exclusively play in pre-arranged groups of five, commonly known as 5-man teams. This strategy masks individual shortcomings and creates a misleading impression of competence. However, in more varied or random team settings, his detrimental impact becomes more evident. In contrast, playing with random teammates, while unpredictable, can offer a more balanced and less frustrating experience. Random players are less likely to exhibit the same level of self-centered gameplay or deliberately sabotage team efforts. Thus, it is often preferable to take a chance with random teammates rather than endure the consistent negative impact of playing with Omega."</small></p>

<small>There’s nothing I can say about <font color="#827ee9">uCANTstopME</font> that you can’t already find on Reddit or the Blizzard forums, where people frequently complain about how toxic and grief-prone he is. In my experience, he either flames his teammates for the most trivial reasons or, more commonly, overextends constantly. He shows no respect for opponents, repeatedly putting himself in dangerous, poorly positioned situations and dying over and over, without learning from his mistakes. Even if you try to talk to him or ping him, it has no effect—he’ll still selfishly, carelessly, and recklessly charge in as if he’s a god-tier player (he’s far from it) and end up dying just the same. Given his horrible attitude, abysmal in-game stats and track record and the fact he has several permanently banned accounts of the same name, why would anyone consider playing with such a selfish person? The answer is simple—you shouldn’t! "But how is he still in high-ranked lobbies? It’s simple: when he drops too much, too quickly on his own, he starts stacking in Storm League as a group of 3 or 4 to prey on Diamond players, which brings him right back up. Then, he loses points on his own again—a never-ending cycle that frustrates everyone who ends up with him on their team. I truly feel sorry for the unfortunate souls who get him on their team in Ranked.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"uCANTstopME is a well-known player within the Diamond range, often recognized for his highly controversial behavior in his games. His playstyle and in-game conduct have garnered significant attention, primarily due to the negative impact he is reported to have on his teams. Multiple reports across various forums, including Reddit and Blizzard’s official platforms, highlight uCANTstopME’s frequent toxic behavior. This includes verbal abuse towards teammates for minor mistakes and a propensity to flame others and spam-ping for trivial reasons. He is frequently observed overextending in games, placing himself in risky and disadvantageous positions, leading to repeated deaths. This reckless behavior is often coupled with a refusal to adapt or learn from mistakes, resulting in consistent poor performance. uCANTstopME is reportedly one of the most frequently reported players in the community. Despite daily reports from numerous players, he remains active in the ranked ladder, causing ongoing frustration among those who encounter him. His conduct has led to widespread dissatisfaction within the player base, with many questioning why such behavior has not resulted in more severe consequences, such as a permanent ban. His presence in games is often cited as a significant factor in creating a negative experience for his teammates, making it challenging for others to enjoy competitive play."</small></p>

Confident in his superiority, he picked Lucio himself, only to be vastly outhealed by an Abathur. This instance (among many others) highlights the discrepancy between his self-perception and actual skill level, exacerbating the frustration for those who play with him."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Devilforce</font> is a mean, two-faced toxic scrub whose sole path to victory seems to rely on abusing 5-stacking and only with the most self-sustains & pushers. I’ve never had trouble playing against their stack; they can only defeat inexperienced players. When faced with a decent opponent, they tend to crumble, revealing their actual skill level. His proficiency otherwise is far from exceptional. Additionally, he consistently monitors his in-game "friends," though the reason for this persistent tracking remains unclear—perhaps it’s due to "professional jealousy." This behavior may be related to the fact that, while the website Hotslogs was still active, he abused it by uploading only his wins to manipulate the leaderboard. After I completely removed and blocked him from my peers, he tried several times to ask others to "send me messages." Although I did not receive any, I was informed that these messages were very mean-spirited and outright toxic..</small></p><br>

<small><font color="#827ee9">FesS</font> is a Lunara one-trick pony (OTP) who is pretty mediocre at it and rarely earns his keep in a party. I’ve often out-damaged him on healers like Lucio and Brightwing when he’s playing in a 5-stack with us. He is dependent on being part of a 5-stack and would never be the person to take the game into his hands and carry, partly because of his hero choice, but partly because of a notable lack of skill. Once, when we suggested we make different picks so games were normal and less "abusive" and even go Unranked Draft, he quickly refused, saying he wants to stay on his hero, unwilling to change— as if 5-stacking with four assassins and one healer presents any real challenge. He even suggested he leaves and rejoins us later when we want to play normal. So abusive 5-man is normal for him LOL. If that wasn’t enough, he speaks behind people’s backs when they’re not in the party, but acts nice to them when they rejoin. Dishonest, deceitful scum.</small></p><br>

His awkward remarks in voice chat lack fluidity and can be quite off-putting, adding another layer of difficulty to interact with him.

<small><font color="#827ee9">Cubrick</font> is not the worst teammate I’ve ever had the misfortune of playing with, but he is certainly among the most vindictive, toxic, and game-sabotaging individuals I’ve encountered. He has a well-established pattern of throwing games if you dare to disagree with or challenge him, displaying no remorse for his actions. His behavior is marked by a complete disregard for team dynamics and a willingness to undermine the game’s progress out of spite. Cubrick’s actions suggest a level of toxic sociopathy, where his primary focus seems to be causing disruption rather than contributing constructively. His presence in a game often results in a significant disadvantage for his team, making him a highly problematic player.</p><br></small>

<small>If you want a healer who doesn’t heal, never follows the team, and constantly goes off on his own, just turn to <font color="#827ee9">NoXoMo</font>. I have never seen a healer with such disregard for his team combined with such poor map awareness. He is absolutely never there when you need him - whether it is a crucial fight or pushing the objective, he is completely oblivious to the team’s needs. His behavior indicates a complete lack of situational awareness and disregard for teamwork. His gameplay is so consistently poor that it seems almost intentional. I’m increasingly convinced that he is the guy streamers go to when they need bronze accounts for their Bronze to GM climb streams.</small></p><br>

He has absolutely no notable skills and extremely poor map awareness. Although I’ve faced his 5-man group multiple times, he’s always performed poorly. One instance stands out where he died four times as Abathur without seeing any of the kills coming. He was fully exposed and unaware of it. And even when attacked, his reaction timing to move always came too late, even for a random Abathur player. I’ve never seen an Abathur player with such poor map awareness; even random Abathur players are ten times better.

If he had spent as much time playing the game as he did typing in the team chat, he could have been an amazing player. His in-game metrics were abysmal. He would consistently pick a squishy glass cannon and play recklessly, expecting the healer to focus solely on him and ignoring the needs of the rest of the team. Even when warned or pinged to back off, and despite being informed that saving abilities were on cooldown, he continued to overextend, die, and whine afterward. I’ve genuinely never seen anyone type so much in one game—most players don’t type as much in their entire HotS career as he did in a single match. It’s truly outrageous, and I’m relieved he’s out of HotS, as I still have nightmares about playing with this delusional, self-centered immature player.</small></p><br>

I don’t know Sunwind personally and I’ve never spoken to him. Perhaps he is a nice guy, but he seems absolutely clueless ingame. I would give a newcomer a break, but he has played a lot and still hasn’t improved; his stats are abysmal. When I first played with him, I couldn’t believe he was a real person and not a bot. He would mindlessly int and die four times as Tyrael in just two minutes. He would start the boss fight as a tank, and when nobody came to his aid, he wouldn’t give up—he’d stay until he died to the boss and then repeat. I have no idea why he can’t improve even a little and keeps making the same mistakes. There were some comments that he was toxic, but I haven’t seen that myself, so I can’t comment on it. All I’ve seen is that he’s social and quite active on Reddit. But yeah, hard pass from me on ever playing with him again.</small></p><br>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Ironside</font> is a manipulative individual and a crybaby who is adept at portraying himself as the aggrieved party. He has thrown many games with his reckless, careless behavior, claiming to be a Grandmaster while delivering extremely lackluster and unreliable performances. He is quick to deflect criticism of his abysmal performance, complaining and whining to others, all the while pointing fingers at others and reshaping the narrative to cast himself in a favorable light and gain sympathy. One time, when I was playing only Valla (and he knew it), he joined the party, instantly locked Valla, and sarcastically asked, "Oh, zero, did you want to play Valla?" I called him out on his behavior and was done with him. Still, gotta give him kudos—he managed to fool a lot of (gullible) people with his bs narrative.</small></p><br>

<small>A story as old as time - A guy jumps into the enemy team 1v5, dies, and then spams pings at his teammates, blaming them for not following and <font color="#827ee9">YoneOTP</font> is the flag-bearer of it. YoneOTP is one of the biggest inters and griefers you’ll ever encounter in Ranked play in Heroes of the Storm. This player has a complete disregard for strategy, lacks any sense of self-preservation, and is almost guaranteed to intentionally and mindlessly dive in, even when there is absolutely no chance of him coming out victorious. Even if you politely ask him to wait for the team, he’ll ignore you. It looks like he gets his kicks from diving headfirst into the entire enemy team, leading to a spree of intentional feeding more often than not. Don’t just take my word for it; the stats speak for themselves. He has the worst performance of any Storm League player on the roster, with a K/D ratio below 1.0, which is extremely rare. I love an aggressive playstyle, but there’s a fine line between being aggressive and just plain idiotic and reckless. Combined with his disrespectful and unsportsmanlike behavior, he makes the game miserable for nine other players while amusing only himself. It’s hard to think of a worse teammate to have on your side. And, of course, he’ll make sure to ping you whenever he dies, blaming you in the process, never his fault. Completely delusional.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"YoneOTP is a player in Heroes of the Storm known for consistently displaying a reckless and disruptive playstyle. Frequently diving into the enemy team 1v5 with little regard for strategy or team coordination, YoneOTP often ends up feeding and then shifts blame onto teammates through excessive pinging. This behavior is not only frustrating but also detrimental to the team’s overall performance. Despite any attempts from teammates to encourage a more coordinated approach, YoneOTP typically ignores such advice and continues with a high-risk, low-reward strategy that rarely succeeds.<br>Statistically, YoneOTP ranks among the lowest performers in Storm League, with a K/D ratio below 1.0—a rarity that underscores his ineffective playstyle. While some players favor aggression, YoneOTP frequently crosses the line into reckless and self-sabotaging behavior, often to the detriment of his team. His unsportsmanlike conduct and refusal to adapt make him a challenging teammate, often resulting in a negative experience for others in the game."</small></p>

Or is game sabotaging just a hobby of yours? In any other game, you’d be permabanned. That’s why you’re in HotS, you piece of shit. Seriously...<br><img src="fuck-you-how-high.gif"></small></p><br>

<small>I hope for all of humanity’s sake that meeting someone as delusional and toxic as <font color="#827ee9">Rayze</font> is an extremely rare event. Let me elaborate. A Valla with a 25% quickmatch winrate gets invited to our duo group, he then proceeds to die 8 times very quickly, starts flaming me (the tank), making false claims such as I didn’t blind the enemies, that I didn’t tank, that I didn’t press abilitites, all of the things I did sufficiently, while I was trying desperately to win the game and to cover for his egotistical recklessness. He starts drama during and after games, flames others, and fabricates lies to create a narrative that suits his skewed version of events, even when in-game witnesses can confirm otherwise. When confronted with undeniable evidence, his response is a dismissive "never liked him anyway." Even when I wasn’t there and our mutual friend streamed games (on different occassions too), Rayze would always have something negative to say and criticize the randoms on his team, despite not being more useful himself. Ignorance is bliss for some, but seems to be a safe haven for Rayze. While there are more toxic players in HotS, few are as delusional. He acts as an authority in the game, as if he works on balancing it, and among other things, suggests a terrible Anduin build to his friends, claiming it’s the best build for him:<br><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PxwV923v/suggested.png" width="300"><br>In what universe is that a good build? Also, while he claimed that others have abused HeroesProfile stats by uploading only wins, he himself has also inflated his solo queue stats by selectively uploading only his wins to HeroesProfile during two seasons in 2023, solidifying himself as an abusive & manipulative hypocrite.<br>So screw you, Rayze—you toxic, delusional hypocrite. Keep pretending you’re the victim while spreading your lies.</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Rayze is a highly toxic and delusional individual with a tendency to shift blame onto others and create drama.

<small><font color="#827ee9">BETRÜGER</font> is one of the most toxic and harmful individuals you will ever encounter in HotS. Skill-wise, he isn’t terrible, but he is guilty of endlessly smurfing and being hard-stuck in diamond and low master. He constantly flames and blames teammates, never once admitting he might have misplayed, and never even considering that he might be at fault. He will frequently badmouth people during and after the game, berating them, calling them trash, criticizing their gameplay and basically using any excuse he can for his own selfish and reckless behavior ingame. He will whisper you and/or add you to friends after a game just to flame you. This creates a never-ending cycle of playing the blame game. You might recognize him from his low-quality clip compilations, where he calls himself as the best Tracer player in the world <img src="https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/381875/2" width="15">! Although I am certain that if one tried, they would make an ever bigger compilation of him misplaying and being trash. Very selective of his clip selection, yeah? That is probably why he has disabled all of this HeroesProfile stats, so that you cannot dig up his replays, his games, his multiple mistakes and his toxic behavior. There are also many who claim that he is maphacking or scripting (and no, that doesn’t refer to the low-quality textures he’s using, but actual 3rd party software that gives him unfair advantages. He’s essentially just smurfing in Diamond 2 to farm clips against inexperienced players, otherwise, his behavior is completely utterly awful. And if he isn’t getting the clips/plays he wants and enemies actually use brains, he will give up, spam-ping & intentionally feed until enemies FF. [<a href="2024-09-04 03.01.35 Cursed Hollow.StormReplay">example game</a>, he is the Tracer]. He is a completely delusional sociopath who would have been permanently banned in any other game with active mods/admins. Bravo, Blizzard, once again!"</small></p><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"BETRÜGER is a highly controversial figure within the HotS community. While his gameplay skills can be adequate, he is almost always engaging in disruptive behavior, including smurfing on lower-rank players and remaining stuck in the diamond and low master ranks himself. He is consistently blaming teammates, never admitting to his own mistakes, and exhibiting a lack of accountability. His conduct during and after matches is marked by frequent negative comments towards others, including nasty insults and unwarranted criticism of their gameplay and talent choices. This behavior has led to him being labeled as extremely toxic by many players. BETRÜGER is known for his clip compilations, where he claims to be the best Tracer player in the world (which is a complete and utter joke). There are also many respected players within the HotS community that all independently of each other claim he is using scripts/maphacks and although there is no hard evidence for it, he is most likely playing with scripts."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Tychessa</font> isn’t just toxic—he’s the embodiment of everything wrong with online gaming. Not only is he condescending and egotistical, but he also exhibits straight-up sociopathic and racist tendencies, making every lobby he joins actively worse. His arrogance is laughably misplaced, considering he has a pathetic 38.5% solo win rate in Storm League (with most of his other stats still below 50%). Yet, in his delusional mind, he’s never at fault—always blaming teammates while refusing to take even an ounce of accountability.  
His in-game behavior is nothing short of a disaster. If he dies, it’s never his fault. It’s yours. Or anyone’s, really—except for his equally braindead stack. He flames endlessly, intentionally throws games, and then hops right back into Twitch chat spamming emojis like a socially stunted gremlin. He thinks he’s being funny or edgy, but in reality, he’s just a pathetic, insufferable brat.  
And don’t even get me started on his voice. That nasally, prepubescent whining is more grating than anything else, like listening to a mosquito throw a tantrum in broken English. The fact that someone like him still has an account is proof that Blizzard’s moderation team is either asleep or just doesn’t give a shit.
Tychessa isn’t just a detriment to the community—he’s a plague, toxic and delusional and is the very definition of a player who should have been permanently banned ages ago. Still, if you are an 8K Master player and you want to drop to 2k real fast, give him your account. He is really good at that!</p></small><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Tychessa has been frequently observed exhibiting extremely toxic behavior in HotS. He is often one of the first to give up in a game and tends to shift blame onto others, even during the draft phase. If dissatisfied with his performance, such as after dying in-game, he may deliberately sabotage his team’s efforts by intentionally diving towers/losing, to speeden the end of the match. His use of multiple smurf accounts enables him to continue playing despite bans or suspensions, which are often a consequence of his toxic behavior and blaming anyone except himself and his duo/trio partners. Some view him as overestimating his abilities and displaying a toxic, edgy attitude that alienates others. His 38.5% solo win rate in Storm League does little to support his inflated assessment of his own skill. Associating with him will be potentially damaging to one’s reputation.."</small></p>

<small><font color="#827ee9">Shando</font> is hands down the most vile, toxic person I’ve ever encountered online—and I’ve met some seriously awful people. In just five hours, he told me to kill myself in multiple ways, over and over, with zero creativity or self-awareness. I didn’t even respond—and he just kept going. I’ve never seen someone so relentlessly hateful and unhinged. You might catch him in Twitch chat, tossing around emojis and looking like just another harmless viewer. Don’t be fooled. The moment you beat him in a game and he doesn’t like it, he flips. Suddenly, he’s telling you how to hang yourself, how to die, spewing some of the most revolting garbage imaginable. He’s not just toxic—he’s a truly disgusting human being and isn’t just toxic—he’s the embodiment of the worst thing about online gaming - unpunished, delusional, vilely toxic behavior. DM for proof, have about 60 screenshots of him being EXTREMELY toxic. Stay away from him and do not engage. If you encounter him in a game or community, report his behavior immediately through the appropriate channels. The only way to curb this kind of relentless toxicity is to hold individuals like him accountable. Don’t tolerate it. Call it out, report it, and help make online spaces safer for everyone.</p></small><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Shando is widely regarded by many players as one of the most toxic figures in online gaming. In multiple interactions, he sends repeated, unsolicited messages encouraging self-harm—often without provocation and continuing for hours, even when ignored.

He frequently targets players with vile, personal messages in private, including graphic insults and death wishes. He shows no remorse and openly admits to griefing games, wintrading, and intentionally sabotaging matches—often claiming he will continue doing so indefinitely. His behavior highlights a larger issue in online gaming: unchecked, delusional toxicity that thrives without consequences.

<small>I know this breaks the whole “no ad hominem” rule, but <font color="#827ee9">Razhag</font>’s family tree looks like a straight line. Seriously, no exaggeration — this guy has single-handedly thrown more games than anyone I’ve ever seen. He plays like a reckless, selfish, disrespectful show-off who thinks stomping some platinum players makes him some kind of ultra-skilled legend, while in reality he is a pretty poor, reckless, incoherent and inconsiderate player. He always overextends into oblivion like he’s invincible. Delusional doesn’t even begin to cover it. I challenge you to find someone who’s lost more ranked games by themselves than him. Easily the worst teammate I’ve ever had in HotS, and believe me I have had some terrible ones.</p></small><br>
<p class="text-center fw-bold"><img src="hotsbullet.png" width="12"> <small>Description from Objective List:<br>"Razhag has consistently demonstrated gameplay patterns that contribute negatively to team outcomes in ranked Heroes of the Storm. His decision-making often involves high-risk (no reward) overextensions, even in situations where a more conservative approach would secure a win. For example, during pushes with a three-level lead, boss control, and lane pressure, he has frequently been observed engaging alone and dying unnecessarily, resulting in lost momentum or outright game losses. Despite him attempting to guide others (big mistake), his playstyle reflects a lack of adaptation and team coordination, often prioritizing aggressive plays over strategic positioning or timing. While he may perform well against lower-tier opponents, this does not translate reliably into high-level matches. His tendency to disregard macro advantages in favor of solo plays has, on multiple occasions, directly led to avoidable defeats. Due to this consistent pattern, you will find it more productive to dodge him in ranked environments where team coordination and decision-making are critical."</small></p>
