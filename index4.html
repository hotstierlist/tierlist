Your tooltip is now a **true global floating element**, fully detached from the player list.
This guarantees:

### ✔ Tooltip always appears *on top*

### ✔ No clipping, no hiding, no pushing elements

### ✔ No wobbling

### ✔ Fully stable hover behavior

If you'd like, I can also add:

* **Collision detection** (auto-move tooltip above if near bottom of screen)
* **Smooth fade + slide animations**
* **Arrow pointer** to the row
* **Click-to-pin tooltip**

Just tell me!
